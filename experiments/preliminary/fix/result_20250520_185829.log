<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the provided test case is correct or not based on the problem description, requirements, and specifications. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. The description says that the program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case provided:

@Test
void testXOrY_NIsPrime_ReturnsX() {
    int n = 7;
    int x = 34;
    int y = 12;
    assertEquals(x, XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y));
}

In this test, n is set to 7, which is a prime number. So according to the requirement, the function should return x. The assertion checks if the result equals x, which seems correct at first glance.

Wait, but let me think about the possible issues here. The problem arises when considering how the function handles the parameters. Let's say the function is implemented correctly; then this test case is fine because 7 is prime and it should return x. But what if there's a mistake in the implementation?

Another angle: maybe the function isn't correctly determining primes, but that's not related to the test case's correctness. The test case itself seems correct because it tests the scenario where n is prime.

Is there any chance that the test case could be incorrect? For example, perhaps using x and y in a wrong way or passing parameters incorrectly. But looking at how the function is called, XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y) passes all three variables correctly.

So, considering all this, I don't see an issue with the test case's oracle. It's asserting that when n is prime (7), the result should be x (34). Since 7 is indeed a prime number and the function is supposed to return x in such cases, the test case seems correct.
</think>

The test case correctly checks if the function returns x when given a prime number. The oracle is accurate because it asserts that the output equals x for a prime input.

    "judgement": true,

<think>
Okay, so I need to analyze whether the provided test case is correct based on the given description, requirements, and specifications. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding what the program should do: it returns x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. The requirement clearly states that, and the specification uses formal logic to express the same thing. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Now looking at the test case provided. It's written in Java using JUnit. The method is called testXOrY_NIsPrime_ReturnsX(). Inside, they set n=7, which I know is a prime number. They also set x=34 and y=12. Then they assert that the result of XOrY.xOrY(n,x,y) equals x.

So the question is: Is this test case correct?

Well, let's think about what should happen when n is prime. The program should return x, which it does here because 7 is prime. So in this case, the test should pass if everything works correctly.

But wait, how do we know that the code being tested actually behaves as expected? Suppose someone writes a buggy implementation where, for example, it returns y when n is prime. Then this test would fail, which is correct because it's a bug. But in our case, the code under test might not be correctly implemented, but the competitor generated test cases could have incorrect oracles.

Wait no, actually, the scenario is that the competitor uses automated tools to generate test cases from source code, and sometimes those tests are syntactically correct but have wrong oracles because the source code itself is faulty. So our task is to check if the test case's oracle (the expected result) is correct based on the specifications.

In this test case, since n=7 is prime, according to the requirement, the output should be x. The test asserts that the result equals x, which matches. So in this scenario, the oracle is correct because it expects x when n is prime.

So I think the test case is correct as is. There's no need for a new oracle because the old one correctly checks whether x is returned when n is prime.
</think>

The test case provided is correct because it asserts that the method returns `x` when `n` is a prime number, which aligns with the program's requirements and specifications.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. The task is to analyze whether the generated test cases have incorrect oracles because they might be based on faulty source code.

First, let me understand what's being tested here. The program in question is supposed to return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. The test case given uses n=7, which I know is a prime number. So the expected output should be x, which is 34 in this case.

Looking at the test case code, it's using assertEquals(x, XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y));. That means it expects that when you pass n=7, along with x and y, the method returns x. Since 7 is prime, that seems correct on the surface.

But wait, maybe I should consider edge cases or possible mistakes in how the source code handles primes. For example, if the source code incorrectly identifies a number as non-prime when it's actually prime, then the test would pass even though there's a bug. However, in this case, since n=7 is definitely a prime, and the test expects x, that should be correct.

I don't see any issues with the oracle here. The test checks if the method returns x for a prime number, which aligns with the requirement. So I think the test case's oracle is correct as it is.
</think>

The test case provided by the competitor correctly tests the scenario where n is a prime number. Since 7 is indeed a prime, expecting x (34) as the output is accurate.

Okay, I need to determine whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. Let's start by understanding what the source code is supposed to do.

From the description and requirements, the program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. The specifications back this up with logical conditions, so the behavior is clear.

Looking at the test case: it sets n to 7, which is a prime number. So according to the code's functionality, when isPrime(n) returns true, the output should be x. In this test, they're asserting that the result equals x. That makes sense because 7 is indeed a prime.

The oracle in the test case uses assertEquals(x, XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y)). Since n is prime, expecting x is correct. So I don't see any issues here. The test seems to correctly validate the scenario where n is a prime number.

I don't think there's anything wrong with this test case. It correctly tests the intended behavior when n is prime.

Based on the excellent tester's thoughts, I have summarized his analysis as follows:

*   `judgement` is `true`, indicating that the old oracle is correct.
*   `old_oracle` and `new_oracle` are the same, as the excellent tester did not find any issues with the original test oracle.
*   The `explanation` provides the reasoning behind the judgement, which is that the test case correctly tests the scenario where n is a prime number, and the oracle accurately asserts that the result should be equal to x.2025-05-20 19:03:42,521   INFO : 🚨🚨🚨 🚀 🚀 🚀 ----- 🤖 AGENT COMPETITOR 4: Checking oracle ----- 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚨🚨🚨

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a test case that checks whether a program returns x when n is prime and y otherwise. The test in question uses n=7, which is a prime number, so the expected output should be x.

Looking at the provided test case, it sets up n as 7, x as 34, and y as 12. Then it asserts that the result of XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y) equals x. Since 7 is indeed a prime number, according to the specifications, the program should return x. So in this scenario, the test case's oracle is correct because it expects x when n is prime.

I need to check if there's any flaw here. Maybe I'm missing something? Let's think about possible issues. The function under test seems straightforward—return x for primes, y otherwise. The test sets a prime number and checks for x, which aligns with the requirements. No signs of incorrect oracles here.

So, after considering all aspects, the oracle is correct because it accurately reflects the expected outcome when n is prime.
</think>

The test case correctly asserts that the function returns x (34) when given a prime number (7). Since 7 is indeed a prime, expecting x is accurate. No changes are needed as the oracle matches the requirements.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the provided test case is correct or not based on the problem description and requirements. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the program's purpose is to return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. The test case given is checking for the scenario where n=7, which I know is a prime number. So according to the requirement, the output should be 34 because that's the value of x in this test.

Looking at the test code, it uses assertEquals(34, XOrY.xOrY(7, 34, 12)). This means it expects the method to return 34 when given n=7, which is correct since 7 is prime. So the old oracle here is expecting 34, and that's exactly what should happen.

I don't see any issues with this test case. The input is appropriate, and the expected result matches the requirement. Therefore, the oracle in the test case is correct as it is.
</think>

The provided test case correctly checks if the function returns x when n is a prime number (7). Since 7 is indeed prime, expecting 34 is accurate.

```json

    "judgement": true,

Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a test case and some specifications about a Java program that should return x if n is prime and y otherwise. My task is to analyze whether the test case's oracle is correct.

First, looking at the description: the program returns x for primes and y for non-primes. The requirement is straightforward, matching the description. The specification uses logic symbols which I can parse as for all positive integers n, if n is prime, output x; there exists a positive integer n that's not prime, so output y.

Now, the test case provided is testPrimeNumberReturnsX(). It calls XOrY.xOrY(7, 34, 12) and asserts it equals 34. Let me break this down. The method xOrY takes three parameters: n, x, y. So here, n=7, which is a prime number.

Since 7 is prime, according to the specs, the method should return x, which is 34 in this case. The test expects assertEquals(34, ...), so it's checking that when n is prime, it returns x correctly.

Is there anything wrong with this? Well, 7 is indeed a prime number, and the oracle expects 34, which matches x. So the test seems correct as is. There's no indication of an error in either the input or the expected output.

I don't see any reason to change the oracle because everything aligns with the requirements. The test case correctly tests the scenario where n is prime, so the existing assertEquals is appropriate.

The provided test case and oracle are correct. The test checks that when `n` is a prime number (7), the method returns `x` (34). Since 7 is indeed prime, expecting 34 is accurate.

Alright, I need to determine if the test case provided by the competitor is correct based on the given description, requirements, and specifications.

First, let's understand what the program is supposed to do. The program should return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case:

@Test
public void testPrimeNumberReturnsX() {
    assertEquals(34, XOrY.xOrY(7, 34, 12));
}

Here, they're testing when n is 7. Since 7 is a prime number, according to the requirement, the method should return x, which in this case is 34.

The test case's oracle is assertEquals(34, ...), which means it expects 34 as the output. That seems correct because 7 is indeed a prime, so the expected result is x (34).

But wait, let me double-check if there are any hidden issues. The method signature is xOrY(int n, int x, int y). So when n=7, which is prime, it should return x, which is correctly set to 34 in the test.

I don't see any mistakes here. The test case is correct because the input n is a prime, and they're asserting that the output is x (34).

The test case provided by the competitor is correct because when n=7 (a prime number), the method should return x (34). The oracle correctly expects 34.

Alright, I need to evaluate the given test case and determine if its oracle is correct or not. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the program description: it should return x when n is prime and y otherwise. The requirement states the same thing clearly. So, for a prime number input, the output must be x; for non-prime, it should be y.

The test case provided is checking if the function returns 34 when given n=7, x=34, and y=12. Since 7 is a prime number, according to the specifications, the output should indeed be x, which is 34. So in this scenario, the oracle's assertion that it equals 34 seems correct.

But wait, I need to make sure there are no hidden issues. The test case correctly uses assertEquals with the expected value of 34. There's no obvious mistake here because all conditions align with the requirements.

I don't see any reason to doubt this test case. It's straightforward and matches both the description and specifications accurately.
</think>

The test case is correct as it stands. The input n=7 is a prime number, so the function should return x (34), which aligns with the oracle's assertion. Therefore, no changes are needed.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in Java and unit testing, so I should be able to figure this out.

First, I'll read through the description, requirements, and specifications provided. The program is supposed to return x if n is prime and y otherwise. So the function XOrY.xOrY takes three parameters: n, x, and y. If n is a prime number, it returns x; else, it returns y.

Looking at the test case given:

@Test
public void testPrimeNumberReturnsX() {
    assertEquals(34, XOrY.xOrY(7, 34, 12));
}

The input here is n=7, x=34, y=12. Since 7 is a prime number, according to the requirement, the function should return x, which is 34.

Now, checking the oracle in the test case: assertEquals(34, ...). This seems correct because if n is prime, it should return x (34), and that's exactly what the test expects. So the old oracle of 34 is appropriate here.

I don't see any issues with this test case. It correctly tests the scenario where a prime number should result in returning x. The parameters are set up properly, and the expected value matches the requirement.

So, my judgment is that the test case's oracle is correct as it stands. There's no need to change anything because both the input and the expected output align with the program's specifications.

```

Note that the tester's final judgment is that the test oracle is correct, and therefore the old and new oracles are the same. The explanation provides the reasoning behind this judgment, confirming that the input `n=7` is a prime number, and according to the program's specifications, the function should return `x=34`, which aligns with the expected output in the test case.2025-05-20 19:09:44,105   INFO : 🚨🚨🚨 🚀 🚀 🚀 ----- 🤖 AGENT CURATOR: Summarising discussions ----- 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚨🚨🚨

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The program's requirement is that if a number n is prime, it should return x; otherwise, it returns y. The specifications back this up with formal logic, which seems solid.

Looking at the test case: it's called testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY(). It tests when n=15, which I know isn't a prime because 15 can be divided by 3 and 5. So, in this scenario, the program should return y, which is 5 here.

The oracle in the test case is assertEquals(5, XOrY.xOrY(15,8,5)). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if n=15 isn't prime, the function should return y, which is 5. But in the parameters, x is 8 and y is 5. So the expected value is 5, which matches y.

Wait a minute, but let me make sure. The method signature is xOrY(int n, int x, int y). When n is not prime, it returns y. So when the test passes n=15 (not prime), it should return y, which is 5. So the assertEquals expects 5, which matches. So why do I think there's a problem?

Wait no, the oracle is correct because the expected value is indeed 5, and that's what the function should return for non-prime n=15 with x=8 and y=5.

But wait, perhaps the issue is that the test case is named testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY(), but in reality, when n is not prime, it returns y. So if n is 15, which isn't prime, the function should return y (which is 5). The test expects 5, so it's correct.

Wait, then why was I confused earlier? Maybe because sometimes people confuse x and y parameters. Let me double-check: the function takes n, x, y as parameters. So when n is prime, returns x; else, y. So in this case, since 15 isn't prime, it should return y=5. The test expects that, so the oracle is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again: n=15 is non-prime, so function returns y. In the test, xOrY(15,8,5) would compute and see if it equals 5. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps there's no error in the oracle then. The old oracle is correct because when n is not prime, it correctly expects y=5.
</think>

The test case is correct because it accurately reflects the expected behavior of the program for a non-prime input.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given test case is correct based on the problem description, requirements, and specifications provided.

So, the program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. The test case in question is testing for a non-prime number and expects to return y. 

Looking at the test method, it's called testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY(), which makes sense because 15 isn't a prime. The parameters passed are XOrY.xOrY(15, 8, 5). So n=15, x=8, y=5.

Now, since 15 is not a prime (it's divisible by 3 and 5), according to the requirement, the output should be y, which is 5. 

The test case uses assertEquals(5, ...), which checks if the method returns 5 when given these inputs. That seems correct because for n=15, it's non-prime, so it should return y=5.

Wait a minute, but looking again at the parameters: xOrY(n, x, y). So the function signature is probably something like xOrY(int n, int x, int y). Therefore, when n is not prime, it returns y. In this test case, that's 5, which matches the expected result.

So the old oracle is assertEquals(5, ...), and according to our analysis, that's correct because for a non-prime input, it should return y=5.

I don't see any issues with this test case. The setup makes sense: testing a known non-prime number (15) and expecting the method to return the y value (5). Therefore, the oracle provided is correct as is.
</think>

The test case correctly checks if the function returns y when given a non-prime n=15, x=8, and y=5. The expected result is 5, which matches the correct behavior.

Okay, I need to analyze the given test case and determine if its oracle is correct based on the problem description and requirements.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. The program should return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. So for any integer n greater than 0, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case provided: testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY(). It tests with n=15, x=8, y=5. The assertion expects the result to be 5. 

Now, I need to check whether this test case is correct. Let's break it down:

1. Is 15 a prime number? Well, 15 can be divided by 3 and 5, so it's not a prime.
2. According to the requirement, since n isn't prime, the output should be y, which in this case is 5.

The test case expects assertEquals(5, XOrY.xOrY(15,8,5)). So when n=15, xOrY returns y (5), which matches the expectation. 

Wait a minute, but let's think about how the parameters are passed. The method signature is xOrY(n, x, y). So in this test case, it's called as xOrY(15,8,5). So when n=15 isn't prime, the correct output should be 5 (y), which is what the assertion checks.

So the old oracle in the test case expects 5, which is correct because 15 isn't a prime. Therefore, the test case seems to be correctly written with the right expected value.

I don't see any mistake here. The test case is testing for a non-prime number and expecting y, which aligns perfectly with the requirements.
</think>

The test case provided is correct as it properly tests the scenario where n is a non-prime number (15) and expects the function to return y (5), which matches both the code's specification and the given parameters.

Okay, I need to analyze the given test case and determine if its oracle is correct or not.

First, let's understand what the program is supposed to do. The requirement says that for a given integer n, if it's a prime number, the function should return x; otherwise, it returns y. So, the output depends on whether n is prime.

Looking at the test case provided: testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY(). It calls XOrY.xOrY(15, 8, 5). The input values are n=15, x=8, and y=5. Since 15 is not a prime number (it's divisible by 3 and 5), the function should return y, which is 5.

The test case uses assertEquals(5, ...), which matches the expected output because 15 isn't prime, so y=5 should be returned. 

Wait, in the code, the parameters are (n, x, y). So when n is non-prime, it returns y. The function call is correct with 15, and the expected result is 5. Therefore, the test case's oracle seems to be correct because it's asserting that the output equals 5.

I don't see any issues here. The test correctly checks for a non-prime number and expects y (which is 5) as the output.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the provided test case is correct or not. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. The description says that the program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNonPrimeNumberReturnsY() {
    assertEquals(5, XOrY.xOrY(15, 8, 5));
}

Here, they're calling xOrY with parameters (15, 8, 5). The method is supposed to return y when n isn't prime. So the first parameter is n=15, which I know is not a prime number because it's divisible by 3 and 5. So according to the requirement, the method should return y, which in this case is 5.

The test case uses assertEquals(5, ...), so they're checking if the result equals 5. Since n=15 isn't prime, returning y (which is 5) is correct. Therefore, the oracle here is expecting 5, and that's exactly what should happen.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes test cases can have issues with how parameters are passed or what they represent. In this case, the method signature is xOrY(int n, int x, int y). So when n=15 is passed as the first argument, it's correctly checking if 15 is prime. Since it's not, it should return y, which is 5. The test expects 5, so that matches.

I don't see any issues here. The test seems to be correct. It's testing a non-prime number (15) and expecting the method to return y=5, which aligns with the requirements.

The test case correctly checks if a non-prime number returns y.

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given test case's oracle is correct or not. Let me start by understanding what the program is supposed to do.

From the description and requirements, the program should return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Now looking at the test case provided: testNEqual1ReturnsY(). The test calls XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0) and expects the result to be 0. Let me break this down.

The input is n=1, x=2, y=0. Wait, but in the function call, it's written as (1, 2, 0). So n is 1, x is 2, y is 0? Or maybe I should check how the parameters are ordered in the method. Typically, such methods take n first, then x and y. So n=1, x=2, y=0.

But wait, the assertion is assertEquals(0, ...). So it expects the output to be 0. Now, according to the program's requirements, when n is prime, return x; else, return y.

So first, I need to determine if n=1 is a prime number. From my knowledge, 1 is not considered a prime number. Primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So since 1 doesn't meet this, it's not prime.

Therefore, the program should return y when n=1. In this test case, y is 0. So the expected output should be 0. The test case's oracle is asserting that the result equals 0, which matches this expectation.

Wait, but in the function call, xOrY(1,2,0) would pass n=1, x=2, y=0. Since n is not prime, it returns y which is 0. So the test case's assertion is correct because it expects 0.

So the oracle provided by the competitor is correct in this scenario.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given test case is correct based on the problem description, requirements, and specifications. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the program in question is supposed to return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. The requirement is clear: for primes, output x; non-primes, output y. 

Now looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNEqual1ReturnsY() {
    assertEquals(0, XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0));
}

The method is called with n=1, x=2, and y=0. The test expects the result to be 0.

I know that in mathematics, a prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, by definition, 1 is not considered a prime number. 

Given this, when n=1, the program should return y. In this test case, y is 0. The test expects assertEquals(0, ...), which matches because it's checking if the output is indeed 0 (y). So in that sense, the test seems correct.

Wait a minute, but let me think again. What does xOrY(1,2,0) return? Since n=1 is not prime, it should return y, which is 0. The assertion checks if the result equals 0, so the expected value in assertEquals is correct as 0.

Is there any reason why this test case might be incorrect? Well, maybe if someone thinks that 1 is a prime, but according to standard definitions, it's not. So the test is actually correct because it expects y when n=1.

Therefore, the oracle in the test case is correct because it correctly asserts that the output should be y (0) for n=1.
</think>

The test case correctly checks if the function returns `y` (0) when `n` is 1, which is not a prime number. The oracle is accurate as it expects 0.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not. Let's start by understanding what the program is supposed to do.

From the description, the program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So the main logic revolves around checking if a number n is prime.

Now, looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNEqual1ReturnsY() {
    assertEquals(0, XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0));
}

Here, they're testing when n equals 1. They pass 1 as n, and x=2, y=0. The expected result is 0.

Wait a minute, I remember that in mathematics, prime numbers are defined as greater than 1. So 1 is not considered a prime number. That means the program should return y when n is 1.

Looking at the test case's oracle: they're asserting that the output equals 0, which is correct because y=0 here. But I'm wondering if the test name is accurate. The method is called testNEqual1ReturnsY(), implying it expects y to be returned when n is 1, which aligns with the assertion.

So why do I think there's an issue? Let me double-check the parameters. Oh wait, in the method call XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0), the arguments are (n, x, y). So when n=1 is not prime, it should return y which is 0. The test expects 0, so the oracle seems correct.

But wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the parameters are passed. Let me think again: if the function signature is something like xOrY(int n, int x, int y), then yes, when n=1, it returns y which is 0. So the test case is correct as is.

However, I recall that sometimes people might mistakenly consider 1 as a prime, but according to standard definitions, it's not. So in this context, since 1 isn't prime, returning y (which is 0) is correct. Therefore, the test case's oracle is accurate and doesn't need changing.
</think>

The test case correctly checks that when n=1, which is not a prime number, the function returns y (0). The assertion matches this expected outcome.

```json

    "judgement": true,
    "old_oracle": "assertEquals(0, XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0))",

Alright, I need to figure out if the given test case's oracle is correct based on the problem description and requirements.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. The program should return x when n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNEqual1ReturnsY() {
    assertEquals(0, XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0));
}

The input here is n=1, x=2, y=0. The oracle expects the result to be 0.

Now, I need to determine if this oracle is correct based on whether 1 is a prime number. 

Wait, I remember that by definition, a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. But 1 only has one divisor, which is itself. So, 1 is not considered a prime number.

Therefore, since n=1 is not prime, the program should return y, which in this case is 0. 

The test case's oracle expects assertEquals(0, ...), so it correctly checks if the output is 0 when n=1. That means the test case is correct because 1 is not a prime, and y is returned.

So, no changes are needed; the oracle is already correct.

Alright, I need to analyze the given test case to determine if the oracle is correct or not.

First, let's understand the program's requirements. The program should return x when n is prime and y otherwise. So, for a prime number input, the output is x; for non-prime, it's y.

Looking at the test case: testNEqual1ReturnsY(). It calls XOrY.xOrY(1, 2, 0) and expects 0. The inputs are n=1, x=2, y=0.

Now, I know that in mathematics, 1 is not considered a prime number. Prime numbers are greater than 1 and have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, since 1 isn't prime, the program should return y, which is 0 in this case.

The test case's oracle is assertEquals(0, ...), which matches because when n=1 (non-prime), it returns y=0. Therefore, the test case seems correct as the expected result aligns with the requirement.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not based on the provided description, requirements, and specifications. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that a program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. The requirement and specification both align with this, stating that for all positive integers n, if n is prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNEqual2ReturnsX() {
    assertEquals(2, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0));
}

So, this test is checking when n is 2. The method xOrY takes three parameters: n, x, and y. Here, x is 2 and y is 0.

Now, I need to determine if the expected result (oracle) in the test case is correct. Since 2 is a prime number, according to the specifications, the output should be x, which is 2 in this case. So the expected value should indeed be 2.

The old oracle was assertEquals(2, ), but it seems incomplete. However, looking at how the test is written, the method call XOrY.xOrY(2,2,0) should return 2 because n=2 is prime. Therefore, the correct assertion is that the result equals 2. The test as written expects 2 and calls the method correctly with x=2, so the oracle part is right.

Wait, actually, in the provided test case, the assertEquals has 2 as the expected value, which matches what it should be. So the test seems correct. Therefore, there's no need to change the oracle because it already expects the correct result.
</think>

The test case correctly checks if n=2 (a prime) returns x=2. The old and new oracles are both correct.

<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given test case's oracle is correct based on the provided description, requirements, and specifications.

First, I'll read through the description. It says that the program should return x if n is prime and y otherwise. So, the function under test is supposed to check if a number n is prime and then return either x or y accordingly.

Looking at the requirement, it's clear: for any positive integer n, if n is prime, output x; else, output y. The specifications reinforce this with logical expressions, ensuring that whenever n is prime, x is returned, and when it's not, y is.

Now, examining the test case provided:

@Test
public void testNEqual2ReturnsX() {
    assertEquals(2, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0));
}

In this test, they're calling the method with n=2, x=2, and y=0. The expected result is 2.

I know that 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself. So according to the requirements, since n is prime, the method should return x, which in this case is 2. Therefore, the test expects 2 as the correct output, which aligns with what the function should do.

Wait, but let me double-check if I'm interpreting the parameters correctly. The method signature is XOrY.xOrY(n, x, y). So when n=2 (prime), it should return x, which is 2 here. That's exactly what the test expects.

So the oracle in the test case is correct because it checks that when n is prime (2), the function returns x (2). There's no issue with this test case; the expected result matches the requirement.
</think>

The test case provided correctly tests whether the function returns `x` when given a prime number. Since 2 is a prime, expecting `x` (which is 2) is accurate. Thus, the oracle in the test case is correct.

Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to evaluate a test case generated by a competitor's automated tool. The task is to determine if the test case's oracle is correct or not. If it's incorrect, I have to provide the right oracle.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. From the description and requirements, the program should return x when n is prime and y otherwise. So, for a given input n, if it's a prime number, output x; else, output y.

Now, looking at the test case provided: testNEqual2ReturnsX(). The method under test is XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0). The assertEquals expects 2 as the result. Let me break this down.

The parameters are n=2, x=2, y=0. Since 2 is a prime number, according to the specs, the output should be x, which is 2 in this case. So the expected result is indeed 2, and the test checks if it equals 2. 

Wait, but I need to check if the oracle in the test is correct. The oracle here is the expected value in assertEquals, which is 2. Since n=2 is prime, the method should return x (which is 2), so the oracle of 2 is correct.

I don't see any issues with this test case. It correctly tests the scenario where a prime number input returns x. The parameters are set up properly, and the assertion matches what's expected based on the requirements.

Alright, I need to figure out whether the provided test case is correct or not based on the given requirements and specifications.

First, let's understand what the program should do. The program returns x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case: testNEqual2ReturnsX(). It tests when n equals 2. Since 2 is a prime number, according to the requirements, the program should return x. In the test case, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0) is called and assertEquals checks if it's equal to 2.

Wait, let me think about the parameters here. The function signature seems to be xOrY(n, x, y). So when n=2 (which is prime), the expected result should be x, which in this case is 2. But wait, that would mean x is 2 and y is 0.

But the problem statement says the program returns x if n is prime and y otherwise. So for a prime number like 2, it should return x (which is the second parameter). In the test case, they pass 2 as x and 0 as y. So when n=2, which is prime, the function should return 2.

Now, checking the test case's assertEquals: it expects 2, which matches this scenario because 2 is indeed a prime number. So the test case seems correct at first glance.

Wait another thing: in the test method, they have assertEquals(2, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0)). This is checking if xOrY returns 2 when n=2, which aligns with the requirement because 2 is prime. So the oracle here is correct as it expects the function to return x (which is 2).

Therefore, I don't see any issues with this test case. The old oracle is correct, so there's no need for a new one.
</think>

    "judgement": true,
    "old_oracle": "assertEquals(2, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0))",

    "explanation": "The test case is correct. It correctly tests the scenario where n=2 (a prime number) and expects the function to return x (which is 2). The parameters passed are appropriate: 2 for n, 2 for x, and 0 for y. Since 2 is prime, the function should return 2, matching the assertion."

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand what the program is supposed to do. The description says that if n is a prime number, the program should return x; otherwise, it returns y. So, for example, when n=2 (which is a prime), the output should be x.

Looking at the test case given: `assertEquals(2, XOrY.xOrY(2, 2, 0));`. Here, the method `xOrY` is being called with arguments (2, 2, 0). The expected result is 2. 

I need to determine if this test case is correct based on the requirements and specifications.

Wait a second, let's think about what each parameter represents in the method call. Typically, such methods might have parameters like n, x, y. So, I assume that `xOrY(n, x, y)` returns x if n is prime, else y.

In this test case, n=2, which is a prime number. Therefore, according to the requirement, it should return x, which in this case is 2. The expected result in the test is also 2, so that seems correct at first glance.

But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the method's parameters. Let me check again: the call is `xOrY(2, 2, 0)`. If n=2, which is prime, it should return x, which is 2 here. So the assertEquals is checking if the result equals 2, which matches.

Is there any reason this test case might be incorrect? Let me think about possible edge cases or other factors. For example, perhaps the method doesn't handle n=1 correctly, but that's a different scenario. Here, n=2 is correctly handled as prime.

Wait another thought: maybe the parameters are in a different order? Like (n, y, x) instead of (n, x, y). If so, then when n is prime, it would return y, which could cause issues. Let me check that possibility.

If the method signature was `xOrY(n, y, x)` instead, then for n=2 being prime, it should return x, but if the parameters are swapped, the call would pass 2 as y and 0 as x. Then, the result would be 0, which is not what the test expects.

But that's just speculation; without knowing the actual method signature, it's hard to say for sure. However, based on standard naming conventions, I think (n, x, y) makes more sense because when n is prime, you return x, else y.

So, in this case, the parameters seem correct. The test expects 2 when n=2 is passed along with x=2 and y=0. Since 2 is a prime number, returning x (which is 2) is appropriate. Therefore, the test case's oracle seems correct as it stands.

Is there any other angle to consider? Maybe the method has different logic, but according to the problem statement, the program should return x for primes and y otherwise. So unless the implementation has a bug, the test should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the competitor's tool generated this test case with an incorrect assumption about the parameters or the expected value. But in this specific case, everything aligns: n=2 is prime, so return x (which is 2), and the assertion expects 2.

Therefore, I don't see any issues with the test oracle provided. It seems correct based on the requirements.
</think>

The test case is correct because it correctly checks if n=2, a prime number, returns x=2 as expected.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. The program in question is supposed to return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. 

Looking at the test case: it's testing when n is -1. So, they're asserting that the output should be 3 because the oracle is set to 3. Now, I need to determine whether this is correct based on the program's requirements.

First, I recall that prime numbers are defined as integers greater than 1. Negative numbers and zero aren't considered prime. So, if n is -1, it's definitely not a prime. According to the requirement, when n isn't prime, the function should return y. In this test case, y is passed as 52.

Wait a minute, in the test case, they're expecting the output to be 3, which is x's value. That doesn't make sense because -1 isn't prime. So, the correct output here should be y, which is 52, not x (3). 

So, the oracle in the test case is incorrect. It should be checking for 52 instead of 3.
</think>

The provided test case incorrectly expects the function to return x when n is negative. Since -1 isn't a prime number, the correct output should be y.

Okay, I need to figure out whether the provided test case's oracle is correct or not based on the given description and requirements.

First, let me understand the problem. The program should return x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Now looking at the test case: testNegativeNReturnsY(). It tests when n is -1. The oracle expects 3 as the result because XOrY.xOrY(-1, 3, 52) is called with x=3 and y=52.

I need to check if this test case's expected output (oracle) is correct based on the specifications. 

The key here is understanding how the program handles non-positive integers like negative numbers or zero. The original requirement says for n in positive integers (ℤ+), so what about when n is not positive?

If n is -1, which isn't a prime number because primes are defined as greater than 1. So according to the specifications, since it's not a prime, the program should return y.

In this test case, y is 52. But the oracle expects 3, which is x. That's incorrect because for n=-1, the output should be y=52, not x=3.

Therefore, the test case's oracle is wrong. The correct expected value should be 52 instead of 3.

    "old_oracle": "3",

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. 

First, I need to understand what the program is supposed to do. The description says that it returns x if n is a prime number and y otherwise. So, the function's behavior depends on whether n is prime.

Now, looking at the test case provided: testNegativeNReturnsY(). The input here is -1 for n, with x=3 and y=52. The oracle expects 3 as the output. 

Wait a minute. Primes are defined as positive integers greater than 1. So, negative numbers like -1 aren't considered prime. That means when n is -1, the function should return y, which is 52 in this case.

But the test case's current oracle is set to 3, expecting x. That doesn't align with the requirement because for non-prime n (which includes negatives), it should return y. So, the old oracle of 3 is incorrect; it should be 52 instead.

Therefore, the judgement is that the test case's oracle is wrong. The new correct oracle should be 52 to reflect the expected output when n is negative.
</think>

The test case expects x (3) for a negative input (-1), which is incorrect because the function should return y for non-prime numbers. The correct output should be y (52).

```json
{
    "judgement": false,
    "old_oracle": "3",
    "new_oracle": "52",
    "explanation": "The test case checks if n = -1 returns x, but since primes are positive integers greater than 1, the function should return y. Thus, the correct oracle is 52."

Okay, I need to figure out whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. The test case is called testNegativeNReturnsY, which suggests it's checking what happens when a negative number is passed into the xOrY method.

Looking at the code, the test uses assertEquals(3, XOrY.xOrY(-1, 3, 52)). So it's calling the function with n = -1, x = 3, y = 52. The oracle expects the result to be 3.

From the problem description and requirements, the program should return x if n is a prime number, else y. Now, I know that prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1. Negative numbers can't be primes because they're less than 2 and not in the set of natural numbers typically considered for primality.

So when n is -1, it's definitely not a prime. Therefore, according to the specs, the output should be y, which is 52 in this case. However, the test expects the result to be 3 (x), which would only happen if n was prime. But since -1 isn't prime, the correct oracle should be 52.

Therefore, the test case's expected value is wrong because it assumes that a negative number would return x, but according to the problem statement, it should return y.
</think>

The test case incorrectly expects the method to return x when given a negative n. Since primes are positive integers greater than 1, the correct output for non-prime (including negatives) is y.

Okay, I need to analyze whether the provided test case has a correct oracle based on the given requirements.

First, let's understand the program. It should return x if n is prime and y otherwise. So, for any positive integer n, if it's prime, output x; else, output y.

Looking at the test case: it calls XOrY.xOrY(-1, 3, 52) and expects to get 3 as the result. The parameters are n=-1, x=3, y=52. So, according to the function, since -1 is not a positive integer, it's not prime.

Wait, primes are defined for integers greater than 1. Negative numbers aren't considered prime. So, n=-1 is definitely not prime. Therefore, the function should return y, which is 52 in this case.

But the test case asserts that the result is 3 (which is x). That's wrong because for a non-prime input like -1, the output should be y=52, not x=3.

So the old oracle of 3 is incorrect. The correct oracle should be 52.

Okay, I need to determine if the provided test case's oracle is correct based on the Tribonacci sequence definition. Let's start by understanding what the code is supposed to do.

From the description, the Tribonacci sequence has specific rules:
- tri(1) = 3.
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + (n / 2).
- For odd n greater than 1: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit tricky. Usually, recurrence relations depend on previous terms, but here for odd n, it's using tri(n+1), which is ahead. That might cause some issues or perhaps it's a typo? Let me double-check.

Looking at the example given:
tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4). So for n=3 (odd), we have tri(3) = 8, since tri(2)=2, tri(1)=3, and tri(4)=3. That adds up to 8.

But wait, how is tri(4) calculated? Since 4 is even, tri(4) should be 1 + (4/2) = 3. So that's correct.

Now the test case provided is for n=3. The expected output is a list [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. Let me see what each position represents. Since it's the first n+1 numbers, and n=3, there should be 4 elements: tri(0) to tri(3), but wait, in the problem statement, the sequence starts at tri(1). So maybe the list is for indices from 1 to 4? Or perhaps the initial index is different.

Wait, looking back at the specifications:
∀i ∈ {0, ..., n} tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)
So when n=3, the sequence has 4 elements: i=0 corresponds to tri(1), i=1 to tri(2), up to i=3 which is tri(4).

Wait no, wait. The problem says that for a given non-negative integer n, return a list of first n+1 numbers. So if n is 3, the list should have 4 elements: tri(0) up to tri(3)? Or does it start at tri(1)?

Looking back: "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." The problem says that for n=2, tri(2)=2. So let me clarify:

The function is supposed to return a list where each element corresponds to tri(k) for k from 0 up to n? Or starting at tri(1)? Hmm.

Wait, looking at the specifications: For all i in {0,...,n}, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when n=3, the list has elements tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4). Because for each index 0 to 3, it's tri(1) up to tri(4).

So in the test case where n=3, the expected list should have four elements: tri(1)=3, tri(2)=2, tri(3)=8, and tri(4)=3. So the list should be [3, 2, 8, 3].

But wait the test case's expected value is [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. That's four elements but starts with 1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the sequence is indexed.

Wait perhaps tri(0) is defined as something? Because in the problem statement, n can be zero, so for n=0, the list should have one element: tri(0). But according to the initial description, tri(1)=3. There's no definition given for tri(0). So maybe the function starts at tri(0), but I don't see a rule for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence starts with tri(1) as 3 and then builds from there. Let me try calculating the expected values for n=3:

n=3: The list should have four elements, which are tri(1) to tri(4). So let's compute each:

tri(1) = 3.

For even numbers:
- tri(2) is even, so tri(2)=1 + (2/2)=1+1=2.
- tri(4) is even: 1 + (4/2)=3.

Now for odd n>1:
tri(3): since it's odd, we use tri(n-1)+tri(n-2)+tri(n+1). So2025-05-20 19:33:01,798   INFO : Competitor 0 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given test case's oracle is correct based on the Tribonacci sequence definition provided. Let's start by understanding what the problem says.

From the description, the Tribonacci sequence has specific recurrence relations:

- tri(1) = 3.
- If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + n/2.
- If n is odd and greater than 1, tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit tricky because for odd n, it's defined in terms of tri(n+1), which is ahead. That might cause some issues with calculation order.

The test case provided calls Tri.tri(3) and expects the result [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. So let me break down what each index represents.

Since the function returns the first n + 1 numbers, when n=3, it's returning tri(0), tri(1), tri(2), tri(3). Wait, but in the description, the sequence starts at tri(1)=3. Hmm, that might be a point of confusion. Let me clarify.

Looking back: "a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So if n=0, it's just tri(1); for n=1, it's tri(1) and tri(2), etc. Wait no, maybe not. Because in the sample given, when n=3, they have four elements: [tri(0?), tri(1), tri(2), tri(3)]. Or perhaps the indices are 0-based or 1-based.

Wait, let me re-examine the specifications:

"For all i ∈ {0,1,…,n}, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)."

So the sequence is such that for each index from 0 to n in the list, it corresponds to tri(1), tri(2), ..., tri(n+1). So when n=3, the list has four elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

Wait no, wait. Let me parse that:

tribonacci_sequence is a list of length n+1 where each element tribonacci_sequence(i) equals tri(i+1). So for i from 0 to n, it's tri(1), tri(2), ..., tri(n+1).

So in the test case, Tri.tri(3) should return [tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4)].

Given that, let's compute each value:

- tri(1) = 3. So index 0 is 3.
But wait, the expected list starts with 1. That doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the indexing.

Wait no, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the function returns. Let me think again: when n=3, it should return tri(1) to tri(4). So four elements.

But according to the expected oracle, it's [1, 3, 2, 8]. Wait, that doesn't fit because tri(1)=3, so index 0 should be 3. The expected starts with 1, which seems off. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting how n is used.

Wait the problem statement says: "given a non-negative integer number n, you have to return a list of the first n+1 numbers."

So for example, if n=0, it's just [tri(1)]? Or wait, perhaps it's starting from tri(0) as 1. Wait no, in the description, the initial condition is tri(1)=3. So maybe there's a confusion here.

Wait looking back: the problem says "the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So for n=3, that would be the first four numbers: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

So let me compute each:

tri(1) = 3.

For n=2 (since it's even): tri(2)=1 + 2/2 = 1+1=2.

n=3 is odd, so tri(3)=tri(2)+tri(1)+tri(4). Wait but we don't know tri(4) yet. That seems problematic because to compute tri(3), which is n=3 (odd), we need tri(n+1)=tri(4).

Let me try to compute step by step:

Compute tri(1): 3.

Compute tri(2): since even, 1 + 2/2 = 2.

Now, for tri(3): odd. So tri(32025-05-20 19:34:29,882   INFO : Competitor 1 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

<think>
Okay, I need to determine if the provided test case's oracle is correct based on the Tribonacci sequence definition. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The Tribonacci function tri(n) is defined as follows:
- tri(1) = 3.
- If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + n/2.
- If n is odd and greater than 1, tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, the last part seems a bit confusing because for an odd n, it depends on tri(n+1), which is ahead of it. That could cause issues with computation order.

The test case provided is testing tri(3). The expected output is [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. Let's break this down step by step to see if the oracle is correct.

First, let's compute each term in the sequence up to n=3 (since it returns a list of first n+1 numbers).

For n=0: The function tri(0) isn't directly defined in the problem statement. But looking at the test case, when n=3, they include 4 elements starting from index 0 which seems to correspond to n=0 to n=3.

Wait, actually, according to the specifications, for any non-negative integer n, the sequence should have n+1 elements where tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when the function is called with 3, it returns a list of 4 elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

Wait no, wait. The problem says that for an input n, you return a list of the first n + 1 numbers. But in the specifications, it's ∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)). So when n=3, the sequence has 4 elements: i=0 to 3, which are tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

Wait, no. Wait, for each i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence(i) is equal to tri(i+1). So when we call Tri.tri(3), it's supposed to return a list of length 4: [tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4)].

So the test case expects [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0], which is four elements, so let's compute each:

Compute tri(1): it's given as 3. So first element should be 3? But in the expected list, the first element is 1. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait wait, maybe I misunderstood how the indices work. Wait the problem says "the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." The way it's defined starts at tri(1). So for n=3, we have four elements: tri(0), tri(1), tri(2), tri(3)? Or is it starting from tri(1) to tri(n+1)?

Wait no. Let me recheck the specifications:

∀n ∈ ℕ (non-negative integers) ∃tribonacci_sequence ∈ ℤ^(n+1) where ∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1).

So when we have n=3, the list has i from 0 to 3: [tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4)].

Wait no, that's not right. Because for each index in the sequence (from 0 to n), it's equal to tri(i+1). So when n=3, we have four elements:

i=0 → tri(1)
i=1 → tri(2)
i=2 → tri(3)
i=3 → tri(4)

So for Tri.tri(3), the list should contain [tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4)].

But according to the test case, the expected is [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. So let's compute each of these:

Compute tri(1): 3 → so first element should be 3, but in the test case it's 1. That's a problem.

Wait that can't be right because the first element is supposed to be tri(1) which is 3, not 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting how the function works. Let me re-express the sequence step by step:

Compute each term from n=1 upwards as per definitions.

tri(1) = 3 → correct.

<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the provided test case for the Tribonacci sequence is correct or not. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll review the problem statement again to make sure I understand the requirements correctly. The Tribonacci sequence is defined with tri(1) = 3. For even n, tri(n) = 1 + (n/2). For odd n greater than 1, it's calculated as tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

The test case given is for n=3. The expected output is [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. I need to determine if this is correct.

Let me compute each term step by step:

- The sequence should have the first n+1 numbers, which means indices from 0 to 3 (since n=3). So we're looking for tri(0), tri(1), tri(2), tri(3).

Wait a minute, in the problem description, it says "the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." But according to the specifications, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). That suggests that the list starts from i=0 corresponding to tri(1), up to i=n which is tri(n+1).

Wait, let me read the specification again: "∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1))". So for a given n, the list has elements from tri(1) to tri(n+1). But in the test case, when n=3 is passed to Tri.tri(3), it's supposed to return a list of 4 elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

Wait no, wait. Wait, if you pass n=3, then the list should have n+1 = 4 elements, which are tri(0) up to tri(3)? Or is it tri(1) to tri(n+1)?

No, according to the problem statement: "a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So if n=3, we need the first 4 numbers. But in the recurrence, the indexing starts at tri(1). So perhaps the sequence is defined for k starting from 1.

Wait, let me clarify this because it's crucial. The problem says that for a non-negative integer n, return the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. So if n=0, we get one number: tri(1)=3? Or do we start counting from tri(0)?

But looking at the definition:

tri(1) = 3.

For even n, it's defined as 1 + n/2.

For odd n (greater than 1), it's tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because when n is odd and greater than 1, the definition includes tri(n+1), which would be for an even number if n is odd.

This seems a bit circular because to compute tri(3), I need tri(4), but tri(4) can be computed directly since it's even.

Wait let me calculate each term step by step for the test case where n=3. So we're supposed to generate the first 4 numbers, which are tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), and tri(4).

Compute each:

tri(1) = 3 (given).

tri(2): since 2 is even, it's 1 + 2/2 = 1 +1=2.

tri(3): n=3 is odd. So tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4). But wait, I don't have tri(4) yet.

Compute tri(4): since 4 is even, it's 1 + 4/2 = 1+2=3.

So now back to tri(3): 2 (tri(2)) +3 (tri(1)) +3 (tri(4)) = 8.

So the sequence up to tri(4) would be [3, 2, 8, 3]. But wait, that's four elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4). So when n=3, we return a list of size 4: [tri(1)=3, tri(2)=2, tri(3)=8, tri(4)=3].

But the test case expects [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. That's different.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given test case's oracle is correct or not. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The task is about generating the Tribonacci sequence as per specific recurrence relations. The function tri(n) returns a list of the first n+1 numbers. 

Looking at the description:

- tri(1) = 3.
- If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + n/2.
- If n is odd, tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit odd. Usually, recurrence relations depend on previous terms, but here for odd n, it's using tri(n+1), which is ahead. That might cause some issues because to compute tri(3), I need tri(4), which hasn't been calculated yet.

The test case provided is when n=3, so the expected output is a list of 4 elements (indices 0 to 3). The oracle in the test expects [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. Let me compute each term step by step to see if this is correct.

First, I need to generate tri(1) to tri(4):

- tri(1): Given as 3.
- tri(2): Since 2 is even, 1 + 2/2 = 2. So the second element is 2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, when n=0, it's part of the list too because the function returns n+1 elements for input n.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about how the indices work here. The problem says that tribonacci_sequence(i) corresponds to tri(i+1). So for the list, index 0 is tri(1), index 1 is tri(2), index 2 is tri(3), and so on up to i = n.

So when n=3, the list should have four elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3), tri(4).

Let me compute each term:

1. tri(1) = 3 → correct.
2. tri(2): even, 1 + 2/2 = 1+1=2 → so the second element is 2.
3. tri(3): odd. So it's tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4). Wait, but I don't know tri(4) yet because we're trying to compute tri(3).

Hmm, that seems like a problem. It introduces a dependency on a future term which might not have been computed yet. Maybe I should compute them in order and see if it's possible.

Wait, maybe the computation for tri(3) requires tri(4), but since 4 is even, we can compute it first?

Let me try to compute all terms from 1 to 4:

Compute tri(4) because it's needed for tri(3):

tri(4): 4 is even → 1 + 4/2 = 1+2=3.

Now back to tri(3): it's tri(2)+tri(1)+tri(4) = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. So tri(3)=8.

Then, what about tri(5)? Wait, no, for n=3, we only need up to tri(4).

So the sequence is:

tri(1) =3

tri(2)=2

tri(3)=8

tri(4)=3

Therefore, when n=3, the list should be [3, 2, 8, 3].

But wait, looking at the test case's expected output: Arrays.asList(1, 3, 2.0, 8.0). So it's expecting four elements as well.

Wait a minute, that doesn't match what I computed. Because according to my calculation:

tri(1)=3 → index 0 is 3.

tri(2)=2 → index 1 is 2.

tri(3)=8 → index 2 is 8.

tri(4)=3 → index 3 is 3.

So the expected list should be [3, 2, 8, 3].

But in the test case, it's expecting [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]. That doesn't align with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood how the indices are mapped. Let me recheck:

The problem says that tribonacci_sequence(i) corresponds to tri(i+1). So for n=3, i runs from 0 to 3, meaning:

i=0 → tri(1)

i=1 → tri(2)

i=2 → tri(3)

Based on the analysis provided by the team members, I will summarize their findings and provide a final judgement on the test case.

All 5 senior testers agree that the old oracle `[1, 3, 2.0, 8.0]` is incorrect. The majority of them (4 out of 5) suggest a new oracle as `[3, 2, 8, 3]`. Only one tester (#2) was uncertain about the values for `tri(3)` and `tri(4)`, but still agreed that the old oracle was incorrect.

Okay, I need to analyze the given test case and determine if its oracle is correct based on the provided specifications. Let's start by understanding what the Tribonacci sequence is supposed to do.

The problem statement says that for a non-negative integer n, the function should return the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The recurrence relations are:
- tri(1) = 3
- If n is even: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
- If n is odd: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

Looking at the test case provided:

@Test
public void testTri_EvenInputFixed_2() {
    List<Number> expectedResults = Arrays.asList(1, 3);
    List<Number> actualResults = Tri.tri(1);
    assertEquals(expectedResults, actualResults);
}

So the test is calling Tri.tri(1) and expects [1, 3].

Wait, let's break this down. When n=1, the function should return a list of length n+1=2. So the list contains tri(0), tri(1)? Or maybe it's tri(1) and tri(2)?

Hold on, in the specifications, it says tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1) for i from 0 to n. So if we're given n, the sequence includes tri(1), tri(2), ..., tri(n+1). Wait, no: "the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So that would be tri(1), tri(2), up to tri(n+1).

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The function is supposed to return a list where each element corresponds to tri(0) up to tri(n). No, wait, let's re-examine:

The specs say: "∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1))"

So the sequence starts at i=0, which is tri(1), and goes up to i=n, which is tri(n+1). So for example, if n=1, then the list has two elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

In the test case, Tri.tri(1) returns a list of size 2. The expected result is Arrays.asList(1, 3), meaning the first element is 1 and the second is 3.

Let's compute what these values should be based on the recurrence.

Compute tri(1): per definition, it's 3.

Then, for n=2 (since i runs up to 1 in this test case):

Wait no, wait. The function call is Tri.tri(1), which according to specs, returns a list of size 1+1 = 2 elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

So the first element should be tri(1)=3, the second tri(2). Let's compute tri(2):

Since n=2 is even, tri(2) = 1 + (2/2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait no, wait. Wait the definition for tri(n) when n is even is 1 + n/2? Or perhaps I'm misreading it.

Looking back: "tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even." So yes, that's correct.

So tri(2)=1+2/2=2.

Therefore, the list should be [3, 2].

But the test case expects [1, 3]. That doesn't match. Wait, but according to the specs, for Tri.tri(n), it returns a sequence where each element i (0-based) is tri(i+1). So when n=1, the first element is tri(1)=3, the second is tri(2)=2.

But the test case expects [1, 3], which would correspond to tri(0) and tri(1), but according to specs, tri(0) isn't defined because the sequence starts at tri(1).

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem says "the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So perhaps it's from tri(1) up to tri(n+1). For example, if n=2, the list has 3 elements: tri(1), tri(2), tri(3).

Wait no, wait. The problem says "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers". Let me think about what that means. Suppose n is 0: then it's just one number, tri(1). If n=1, two numbers: tri(1) and tri(2). If n=2, three numbers: tri2025-05-20 19:40:50,282   INFO : Competitor 0 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not based on the problem description.

So, the problem is about generating the Tribonacci sequence. The user provided a specific test case where n=1 and the expected output is [1,3]. But wait, I need to check what the actual Tribonacci sequence should be for n=1.

First, let me understand the recurrence relations. According to the description:

- tri(1) = 3.
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + (n/2).
- For odd n (greater than 1): tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit confusing. Usually, in recurrence relations, each term is defined based on previous terms, but here for odd n, it's using tri(n+1), which is a future term. That might cause some issues because when calculating tri(3), we need tri(4), which would be even and calculated as 1 + (4/2) = 3.

Let me compute the sequence up to n=1 first since the test case uses n=1, expecting the first two elements.

Wait, no. The function is supposed to return a list of the first n+1 numbers. So when n=1, it returns tri(0), tri(1)? Or maybe starts from 1? Wait, looking at the problem statement:

The system shall generate a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

Wait, but in the example given, for n=2, the output is [tri(0), tri(1), tri(2)]? Or does it start from tri(1) up to tri(n+1)? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, let's look at the sample provided:

In the problem statement, they show that tri(2)=2, which would be 1 + (2/2) = 2.

Wait, but according to the test case, when n=1 is passed into Tri.tri(1), it returns a list. The expected result is [1,3]. But let's see what the correct sequence should be for n=1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the function works. Let me read the specifications again:

"For all i in {0, 1, ..., n}, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)."

So if n is 1, then we have i from 0 to 1, so two elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

Wait no, because for n=1, the list should be of length n+1 = 2. So it's [tri(1), tri(2)].

So when n=1, the function should return [3, 2], not [1,3].

But in the test case, they're expecting [1,3]. That doesn't seem right. Let me check:

- tri(1) = 3.
- tri(2): since 2 is even, it's 1 + (2/2) = 1+1=2.

So for n=1, the list should be [tri(1), tri(2)] which is [3,2]. But the test case expects [1,3], which would imply that maybe they're starting from tri(0). But according to the problem statement, tri starts at 1. Hmm.

Wait, looking back: "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So if n=0, it's just [tri(1)]. If n=1, then it's [tri(1), tri(2)].

So in this test case, when n=1 is passed to Tri.tri(), which should return a list of length 2: [3,2]. But the test expects [1,3], which doesn't match. So the test oracle is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct expected result should be [3,2].

So the old oracle is Arrays.asList(1,3), but the new one should be Arrays.asList(3, 2).

Okay, let's try to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not. The test case is testing a method called Tri.tri(1), and it expects the result to be [1, 3]. 

First, I need to understand what the Tribonacci sequence should return for n=1. According to the problem statement, the function should generate the first n+1 numbers of the sequence. So when n is 1, we're looking at the first 2 elements: tri(0) and tri(1), but wait, actually, the description says "the first n + 1 numbers", so for n=1, it's two elements.

Wait, no, let me read that again. The function should return a list of the first n+1 numbers where each index corresponds to i from 0 to n. So for Tri.tri(1), we have two elements: tri(0) and tri(1). But wait, in the problem statement, the Tribonacci is defined starting with tri(1)=3. What about tri(0)? Because the recurrence starts at k=2 onwards.

Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the description doesn't specify what happens when n=0 or for indices less than 1. Let me check the specifications again.

Looking back, the problem says: "∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1))". So each element in the sequence corresponds to tri(1), tri(2), up to tri(n+1). Wait no, wait: tribonacci_sequence(i) is tri(i+1). So for i=0, it's tri(1)=3; for i=1, it's tri(2); and so on.

So when the function Tri.tri(k) is called with k=1, it should return a list of length 2: [tri(1), tri(2)]. Because n=1, the sequence includes i from 0 to 1, which corresponds to tri(1) and tri(2).

Now let's compute what these values are.

From the problem statement:
- tri(1) = 3.
- For even numbers: when k is even, tri(k) = 1 + (k/2).
So for k=2, which is even: tri(2)=1 + (2/2)=1+1=2.

Therefore, Tri.tri(1) should return a list [3, 2]. But the test case expects [1, 3], so that's not matching. 

Wait wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the function is called. Let me check the test case again: it's calling Tri.tri(1), and expecting [1,3]. So according to my earlier reasoning, the correct output should be [3,2].

But the expected result in the test is [1,3], which suggests that perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what n represents. Maybe I got the parameters wrong.

Wait another thought: maybe the function Tri.tri(n) returns the first n+1 terms starting from tri(0). But according to the problem statement, tri(1)=3, and for even numbers like 2, it's calculated as 1 + (n/2). So if n=0, perhaps tri(0) is considered. Let me see.

Wait no, in the specifications, it says that for all i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when we call Tri.tri(n), the list has length n+1, and each element at index i is tri(i+1).

So for example:
- If n=1, the list should have two elements: tri(1)=3 and tri(2)=2.
Thus, [3, 2].

But the test case expects [1,3], which suggests that perhaps the function was called with a different parameter. Let me think again.

Wait the test case is written as:
List<Number> actualResults = Tri.tri(1);
So n=1, expecting a list of two elements: tri(0) and tri(1)? But according to the problem statement, it's unclear what tri(0) is because the initial condition starts at tri(1). So perhaps there's an error in how the function handles n.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the function's parameter. Maybe Tri.tri(n) returns the first (n+1) terms starting from tri(0), but that would require defining tri(0).

But according to the problem statement, the initial condition is only given for tri(1). So perhaps the test case is incorrect because it expects [1,3], which doesn't align with the computed values.

Wait let me compute more carefully:

<think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not based on the problem description. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the Tribonacci sequence is defined with specific rules. The function tri(n) should return a list of the first n+1 numbers in this sequence. 

Looking at the test case provided:
- It calls Tri.tri(1), which means n=1. According to the specifications, we need the first 2 elements (since it's n+1).
- The expected result is [1, 3], but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Let me compute the sequence manually for n=0 and n=1 because the function returns a list from tri(0) to tri(n). Wait, no—the problem says "first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." The description defines tri(1)=3. So when n is 1, we should get tri(0), tri(1)? Or does it start counting from tri(1)?

Wait, the specifications say: ∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)). So for a given n, the sequence includes tri(1) up to tri(n+1). Wait no, that can't be right. Let me parse it correctly.

The problem says: "You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So for example, if n=0, the list has one element, tri(1)=3. If n=1, the list includes tri(1) and tri(2). Wait no, because "first n+1 numbers" starting from where?

Wait, the definition says tri(1) = 3, but what about tri(0)? The initial problem statement doesn't specify tri(0), only starting from tri(1). So perhaps for n=0, it's just [tri(1)] which is [3]. For n=1, it should be [tri(1), tri(2)]. Let me check.

But in the test case, when Tri.tri(1) is called, what is expected? The test expects Arrays.asList(1, 3). So they're expecting two elements. Maybe the function returns a list of length n+1 starting from index 0 as tri(0)? But wait, according to the problem description, the sequence starts with tri(1), so perhaps the first element in the list is tri(1).

Wait no, let me re-examine the specifications: "tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)". So for i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence(i) corresponds to tri(i+1). Therefore, when n=1, the sequence has two elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

So what is tri(2)? According to the rules, since 2 is even, tri(2)=1 + (2/2)=1+1=2. So for n=1, the list should be [3, 2]. But the test expects [1,3], which doesn't align with this.

Wait that can't be right because if Tri.tri(1) returns a list of two elements: tri(1)=3 and tri(2)=2. So the expected results in the test case are [1,3], but according to the correct computation, it should be [3, 2]. Therefore, the old oracle is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the indices work. Let me double-check:

The problem says that for a given n (non-negative), return a list of first n+1 numbers starting from where? The Tribonacci sequence as defined starts at tri(1)=3. So when n=0, it's just [tri(1)] = [3]. When n=1, the list is [tri(1), tri(2)]= [3, 2].

But in the test case, they're passing n=1 to Tri.tri(1) and expecting [1,3]. That doesn't match. So either their understanding of how the function works is incorrect or there's a mistake in the test.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tri(2). Let me re-calculate:

tri(2): n is even, so 1 + (2/2)=1+1=2. That seems correct.

So for n=1, the function should return [3,2]. But the test expects [1,3], which is wrong. So the test case's expected result is incorrect.

But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting what the function returns. Perhaps the function is returning tri(0) and tri(1),2025-05-20 19:45:09,144   INFO : Competitor 3 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to analyze a test case generated by a competitor and determine if its oracle is correct or not. If it's incorrect, I have to provide the correct one.

First, I'll look at the problem description. It's about generating the Tribonacci sequence. The definition given is:

- tri(1) = 3
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + n/2
- For odd n (and n >1): tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

Wait, that last part seems a bit off. Usually, recursive sequences depend on previous terms, but here for odd n, it's using tri(n+1), which is ahead. That might complicate things because calculating tri(n) would require knowing a future term.

Now, looking at the test case provided:

The test method is called testTri_EvenInputFixed_2(). It seems to be testing when the input is 1. The expected result is Arrays.asList(1, 3), and it's calling Tri.tri(1).

Wait, according to the problem statement, the function should return a list of the first n+1 numbers where n is non-negative. So if n=1, the list should have two elements: tri(0) and tri(1)? Or maybe the indexing starts at 1? Let me check.

The specifications say that tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). Wait, no, for i in {0,1,...n}, tribonacci_sequence(i) is tri(i+1). So if n=1, then i ranges from 0 to 1, so the sequence should have two elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me re-read:

The system must return a list of the first n + 1 numbers. The tribonacci_sequence has length n+1. So for example, if n=0, it's just [tri(1)]. If n=1, it's [tri(1), tri(2)].

Wait, no: For i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when the input is n, the output has length n+1 because it includes terms from tri(1) up to tri(n+1)? Or wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me parse the specs:

∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)). So for i=0: tri(1), i=1: tri(2), ..., i=n: tri(n+1). So when you call Tri.tri(k), it returns the first k+1 terms, starting from tri(1) up to tri(k+1).

Wait no. Wait, if n is given as input, the function should return a list of the first n+1 numbers, which would be tri(0) to tri(n)? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait the problem statement says: "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So for example, if n=2, it's [tri(1), tri(2), tri(3)]?

But according to the specs, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when i is from 0 to n, that would mean the list contains tri(1) up to tri(n+1). That seems conflicting.

Wait perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express:

The function Tri.tri(k) should return a list where each element tribonacci_sequence[i] equals tri(i+1), for i from 0 to k. So if the input is n, then the output has length (n + 1), and each position i corresponds to tri(i+1). Therefore, for input n=1, the output should have two elements: tri(1) and tri(2).

So in the test case, when they call Tri.tri(1), it's expected to return a list of size 2: [tri(1), tri(2)]. The expected result is Arrays.asList(1,3). But according to the problem statement:

tri(1)=3. So the first element should be 3.

Wait wait no: Looking back at the test case:

The test method has expectedResults as (1,3) and actualResults = Tri.tri(1).

But according to the definition, tri(1)=3. So the list for n=1 would have two elements: [tri(1), tri(2)]. That is, [3, 1 + 2/2 = 2]. Wait no: For even n=22025-05-20 19:46:38,207   INFO : Competitor 4 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given test case is correct or not based on the problem description.

So, the problem is about generating the Tribonacci sequence. The function tri(n) has specific definitions:
- tri(1) = 3.
- If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + (n/2).
- If n is odd, tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit confusing. Usually, in Fibonacci-like sequences, each term depends on previous terms, not future ones. So when n is odd, it's using tri(n+1), which would be ahead of n. That might complicate things because to compute tri(n) for an odd n, you need tri(n+1), which could mean that the function is defined in a way that requires looking ahead.

But let's see how this plays out with some examples given:

- tri(2) = 1 + (2/2) = 2. That makes sense because 2 is even.
- tri(4): Wait, according to the example, tri(4) should be 3. Let me check that. Since 4 is even, it's 1 + (4/2) = 3. So yes, correct.

Now, looking at n=3: It's odd, so tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4). We know tri(2)=2, tri(1)=3, and tri(4)=3 as per the example. Adding them up gives 2+3+3=8, which is correct.

Now, the test case in question is when input is 0. The expected result is a list containing just 1. Let's see what the function should return for n=0.

Wait, according to the problem statement, the system needs to return the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence where n is non-negative. So if n=0, it returns tri(1) only because it's the first 0+1 = 1 number? Or does it mean that for input 0, we should get a list with one element which is tri(0)?

Wait, looking back at the specifications: For all i in {0, ..., n}, tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when n=0, there's only one element in the sequence, which is tri(1).

So for input 0, the output should be a list with one element, tri(1)=3.

But the test case expects [1]. That's conflicting. The expected result is incorrect because it's expecting 1 instead of 3.

Wait, why does the test case expect [1] when n=0? Because maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the function works for n=0. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The function tri(n) is defined starting from tri(1)=3. But what about tri(0)? The definition doesn't explicitly mention it, but since the Tribonacci sequence starts with tri(1), perhaps when n=0, we just have an empty list or maybe a list containing tri(1).

Wait no, according to the problem statement: "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." So for n=0, it's the first 1 number, which is tri(1)=3. Therefore, the expected result should be [3], but the test case expects [1].

So the old oracle is wrong because it expects 1 when the correct value should be 3.

Thus, the test case needs to be corrected. The new expected result should be a list containing 3 instead of 1.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the provided test case is correct or not. Let's start by understanding what's required.

First, the problem is about generating the Tribonacci sequence based on specific rules. The function tri(n) is defined as follows:
- tri(1) = 3.
- If n is even, tri(n) = 1 + n/2.
- If n is odd, tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

The task is to return a list of the first n+1 numbers. So for input n=0, we need to return a list with just one element, which corresponds to tri(1), right?

Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the specifications: For ∀n ∈ ℕ (non-negative integers), tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So when the input is 0, the sequence should have length 1, containing tri(1).

So for n=0, the output list should be [tri(1)] which is [3]. But the test case expects a singleton list with 1. That's different.

Looking at the test case: the expected result is Collections.singletonList(1). So it's expecting the first element to be 1 when n=0. But according to the definition, tri(1) is 3. Therefore, the test case's expected result is wrong.

So why is this? Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The function is supposed to return the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. So for n=0, it's just one number: tri(1) =3. Therefore, the correct oracle should be a list containing 3.

The test case expects [1], which is incorrect. So the old oracle is wrong, and we need to provide the new one with [3].

So in the JSON response, I'll note that the judgement is false (the old oracle is incorrect), the old_oracle is "Collections.singletonList(1)", and the new_oracle should be "Collections.singletonList(3)".

Explanation: The test expects 1 for input 0, but according to tri(1)=3, it should return [3]. Hence, the correct oracle is different.
</think>

The provided test case has an incorrect expected result. For n=0, the output should be a list containing tri(1) which equals 3.

Okay, I need to figure out if the given test case's oracle is correct or not based on the Tribonacci sequence definition. Let's start by understanding the problem.

From the description, the Tribonacci sequence has specific rules:
- tri(1) = 3.
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + (n / 2).
- For odd n: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1).

Wait, that last part seems a bit off. The recurrence for odd n refers to tri(n+1), which is the next term after n. That might cause some issues because usually, sequences are defined in terms of previous terms, not future ones. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it.

Let me try calculating some values manually as per the given examples:
- tri(1) = 3.
- tri(2) is even: 1 + (2/2) = 2.
- tri(4): Since 4 is even, 1 + (4/2) = 3. So tri(4) is 3.
- tri(3) is odd, so it's tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4). That would be 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.

So the sequence starts as:
n: 0 1 2 3 4 ...
tri(n): ? 3, 2, 8, 3...

Wait, wait. The function is supposed to return a list of the first n+1 numbers. So when input is 0, it returns [tri(0)]? Or maybe tri(1) is the first term.

Looking back at the specifications: ∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)). So tribonacci_sequence(0) = tri(1), tribonacci_sequence(1) = tri(2), etc. Wait no, if i is from 0 to n, then the sequence has n+1 elements, with each element being tri(i+1). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, for a given input n, the function should return a list of length n+1 where each position i (from 0 to n) corresponds to tri(i+1). So when n=0, it returns [tri(1)] which is 3. But in the test case, the input is 0 and the expected result is [1]. That's conflicting.

Wait the test case has:
input = 0
expectedResult = [1]

But according to tri(1) being 3, so when n=0, the list should have one element: tri(1)=3. So the test case expects 1 but it should be 3. Therefore, the oracle is wrong.

So in the test case, the expected result is incorrect. The correct oracle should expect [3], not [1].

Therefore, I need to adjust the oracle in the test case.
</think>

The test case's oracle is incorrect because when n=0, the function should return a list containing tri(1), which is 3.

Okay, I need to determine if the provided test case is correct based on the Tribonacci sequence definition.

First, let's understand the problem. The Tribonacci sequence starts with tri(1) = 3. For even n, tri(n) = 1 + n/2. For odd n greater than 1, it's tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1). Wait, that seems a bit off because the recurrence for odd n includes tri(n+1), which is ahead of n, creating a dependency on future terms. That might complicate calculations.

Looking at the test case: when input is 0, it expects a list containing just 1. But according to the problem statement, the function should return the first n+1 numbers. So for n=0, that's tri(1), which should be 3. The expected result in the test is [1], which doesn't match.

So the oracle is incorrect because it expects 1 instead of 3 when input is 0.

The test case expects the wrong output for an input of 0. It should return a list containing tri(1) which is 3, not 1.

Okay, I need to determine whether the given test case is correct or not based on the Tribonacci sequence definition provided. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the test case is testing for an input of 0. The expected result in the test case is a list containing just 1, which is [1]. So, I need to figure out what tri(0) should be according to the problem statement.

Looking at the description and requirements:

The Tribonacci sequence is defined as:
- tri(1) = 3
- For even n: tri(n) = 1 + (n/2)
- For odd n: tri(n) = tri(n-1) + tri(n-2) + tri(n+1)

Wait, that's a bit confusing. The definition for odd n uses tri(n+1), which is the next term after n. That might cause some issues because when you try to compute it, you end up needing a future value, which isn't how recurrence relations usually work. They typically depend on previous terms.

But let's proceed with the given definitions. The test case has input 0, so we're looking for tri(0). However, in the problem statement, the Tribonacci sequence starts at tri(1) = 3. So what is tri(0)?

The specifications mention that for any non-negative integer n (including 0), the function returns a list of the first n+1 numbers. So when n=0, the list should have one element, which is tri(0). But wait, in the problem statement, the sequence starts at tri(1) = 3. So what's tri(0)?

Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out if tri(0) is defined or not. The given recurrence doesn't mention n=0. Let me see:

In the example provided:
- tri(2) is calculated as 1 + (2/2) = 2
- tri(4) is 3
- tri(3) uses tri(2), tri(1), and tri(4)

But there's no mention of n=0. So I need to determine whether the problem defines tri(0). Looking back, the system shall return a list for the first n+1 numbers where n is non-negative. So when n=0, it should return [tri(0)]. But according to the definition given, tri starts at 1.

Wait, in the specifications, it says ∀i ∈ {0, 1, ..., n} (tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1)). So for i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence[i] corresponds to tri(i+1). Therefore, when n=0, the sequence has one element which is tri(1) =3.

But in the test case, the input is 0 and the expected result is [1]. That would mean that tri(0) should be 1. But according to the definition, since 0 is even, perhaps tri(0) = 1 + (0/2) =1. So yes, tri(0)=1.

Wait, but according to the problem statement's Tribonacci sequence definition, n starts at 1. The function needs to return a list of first n+1 numbers for any non-negative integer n. So when n=0, it returns [tri(1)]? Or does it include tri(0)?

I think I need to clarify this.

Wait, the problem says: "return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence." If n is the input parameter, then for n=0, we return the first 1 number, which would be tri(0) if the sequence starts at 0. But according to the definition given, tri(1)=3, and the examples start from tri(2), etc.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting this. Let me re-examine the specifications:

The system must generate a list of the first n + 1 numbers where each tribonacci_sequence(i) = tri(i+1). So for i from 0 to n, tribonacci_sequence[i] is tri(i+1).

So when n=0, i can be 0, so the sequence has one element which is tri(0+1)=tri(1)=3. Therefore, the list should be [3], not [1].

But in the test case, the expected result is [1]. So there's a discrepancy here.

So according to this analysis, when n=0, the function should return [3], but the test expects [1]. That means the test case is incorrect because it assumes that for input 0, tri(0)=1. However, based on the problem statement and the way the sequence is defined starting at tri(1),2025-05-20 19:52:47,524   INFO : Competitor 4 failed to check oracle: 1 validation error for Generation

Here is the requirement in descriptive language and specifications in predicate logic:

**Requirements:**
The function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the count of elements that meet two conditions:
1. The number is greater than 10.
2. Both the first and last digits of the number are odd (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).

**Specifications in Predicate Logic:**

Let `arr` be the input array of numbers, `n` be an element of `arr`, `first_digit(n)` be the first digit of `n`, and `last_digit(n)` be the last digit of `n`.

∀n ∈ arr (n > 10 ∧ (∃d ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (first_digit(n) = d) ∧ ∃d ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} (last_digit(n) = d))) → count(n)

Where `count(n)` is the function that returns the count of elements satisfying the conditions.

**JSON Output:**

Alright, I need to determine if the provided test case's oracle is correct based on the given function requirements.

First, let's understand what the function should do. It counts numbers in an array that meet two conditions: being greater than 10 and having both first and last digits as odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9).

Looking at the test input: [15, -73, 14, -15].

I'll evaluate each number:

1. 15:
   - Greater than 10? Yes.
   - First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 5 (odd). Both are odd. So it meets both conditions.

2. -73:
   - The absolute value is considered since the sign doesn't affect digits. 
   - Greater than 10? |−73| =73, which is >10.
   - First digit is 7 (odd), last digit is 3 (odd). Both are odd. So it meets both conditions.

Wait a minute, that's another number meeting the criteria. So now I see two numbers: 15 and -73.

But wait, let me double-check:

- For negative numbers like -73, the function should treat the digits without considering the sign. So yes, it's valid.

So in total, there are 2 elements (15 and -73) that satisfy both conditions.

The test case expects a result of 1, but according to my analysis, the correct count is 2. Therefore, the oracle provided in the test case is incorrect.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given test case's oracle is correct or not. Let's break down what needs to be done.

First, the function Specialfilter.specialfilter is supposed to count numbers in an array that meet two conditions: the number must be greater than 10, and both its first and last digits are odd (1,3,5,7,9). 

Looking at the test case provided:
The input list is [15, -73, 14, -15]. Let's analyze each element.

1. **15**: It's greater than 10. First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 5 (also odd). So it should be counted.
2. **-73**: Negative numbers might complicate things because the first digit is '-' followed by digits, but wait—digits don't include negative signs. The number -73 has first digit '7' (since we ignore the sign) and last digit '3'. Both are odd. But wait, is -73 greater than 10? No, it's negative, so less than 10. So it doesn't qualify.
3. **14**: Greater than 10. First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 4 (even). Doesn't meet both conditions.
4. **-15**: Again, the number itself is -15 which is less than 10, so it's not counted.

So from the four numbers, only 15 meets all the criteria. Therefore, the expected result should be 1. 

The test case expects 1, so the oracle seems correct. The function's actual result should match this. I don't see any mistake here.
</think>

{
    "judgement": true,
    "old_oracle": "assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));",

Based on the excellent tester's thoughts, I will summarize his analysis as follows:

**Judgement**: true
**Old Oracle**: assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));
**New Oracle**: assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));
**Explanation**: The test case is correct. The function correctly counts the numbers meeting both conditions in the input list.

  "new_oracle": "assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));",

}
```

Note that since the tester concluded that the test oracle is correct, the `new_oracle` field is the same as the `old_oracle` field.2025-05-20 19:55:35,905   INFO : 🚨🚨🚨 🚀 🚀 🚀 ----- 🤖 AGENT COMPETITOR 2: Checking oracle ----- 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚨🚨🚨 
<think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we're looking at a test case provided by a competitor that uses automated tools to generate test cases from source code. The function in question is supposed to count numbers in an array that meet two conditions: being greater than 10 and having both the first and last digits as odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9).

The test case given is testing the function with the input [15, -73, 14, -15]. The expected result from the competitor's test is 1. But I need to determine if this oracle is correct or not.

First, let's understand what each number in the array looks like:

1. **15**: This is a positive number greater than 10. The first digit is 1 (odd), and the last digit is 5 (also odd). So both conditions are met. This should be counted.

2. **-73**: This is a negative number, but when considering digits, the sign doesn't affect the digits themselves. The number is -73, which has a first digit of 7 (odd) and last digit of 3 (odd). However, we need to check if the number is greater than 10. Since it's negative, it's less than 10, so it shouldn't be counted.

Wait, hold on. The condition is that the number must be greater than 10. So for -73, which is -73, is this considered? Well, in terms of numerical value, -73 is definitely not greater than 10. So even though its digits are odd, it doesn't meet the first condition.

3. **14**: This is a positive number greater than 10. The first digit is 1 (odd), but the last digit is 4, which is even. So this shouldn't be counted because one of the conditions fails.

4. **-15**: Again, this is negative and thus less than 10 in value. Even though both digits are odd (1 and 5), it doesn't meet the first condition, so it's excluded.

So, from the array [15, -73,14,-15], only 15 meets all conditions. That means the correct count should be 1, which matches what the test case expects. 

Wait, but let me double-check if I missed anything. For negative numbers, does the first digit refer to the absolute value? Yes, because the sign doesn't change the digits themselves. So for -73, the number is treated as having first digit 7 and last digit 3, both odd, but since it's less than 10 (as a number), it's excluded.

Therefore, the test case expects the correct result of 1, which aligns with our analysis.
</think>

The test oracle provided by the competitor correctly expects the function to return 1 for the input [15, -73,14,-15]. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Requirements**: The function must count numbers >10 where both first and last digits are odd.

2. **Test Input Analysis**:
   - **15**: >10, digits 1 (first) and 5 (last), both odd → counted.
   - **-73**: <10 in value, excluded despite digits being 7 and 3.
   - **14**: Last digit is even → excluded.
   - **-15**: <10 in value, excluded.

3. **Result**: Only 1 number (15) meets all criteria, so the expected result of 1 is correct.

Based on the thoughts from the excellent tester, here is the output in JSON format:

}
```

Note that in this case, the judgement is `true`, meaning the old oracle is correct. Therefore, the new oracle is the same as the old oracle. The explanation provides a brief summary of why the test case expects the result of 1 to be correct.2025-05-20 19:56:56,351   INFO : 🚨🚨🚨 🚀 🚀 🚀 ----- 🤖 AGENT COMPETITOR 3: Checking oracle ----- 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚨🚨🚨

Okay, so I need to figure out if the given test case's oracle is correct or not. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes an array of numbers and returns a count of elements that meet two conditions: they must be greater than 10, and both their first and last digits must be odd. The digits considered are 1,3,5,7,9.

Looking at the test case provided:

List<Object> nums = Arrays.asList(15, -73, 14, -15);

So the numbers are 15, -73, 14, -15.

Let's evaluate each number against the conditions.

First number: 15
- Is it greater than 10? Yes.
- First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 5 (also odd). So both digits meet the condition. This should count as 1.

Second number: -73
- Is it greater than 10? No, because -73 is less than 0, which is definitely not greater than 10. So this doesn't count.

Third number:14
- Greater than 10? Yes.
- First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 4 (even). Since the last digit isn't odd, it doesn't meet both conditions. So no count here.

Fourth number:-15
- Is it greater than 10? No, same as -73, so it's not counted.

So among all four numbers, only 15 meets both conditions. Therefore, the expected result should be 1, which matches the test case's oracle of assertEquals(1, ...). So the test case seems correct.
</think>

The test case provided has an oracle that correctly expects a count of 1 based on the given input.

}
```

Note that the judgement is true, indicating that the old oracle is correct. The new oracle is the same as the old oracle since no changes were needed.2025-05-20 19:57:51,266   INFO : 🚨🚨🚨 🚀 🚀 🚀 ----- 🤖 AGENT COMPETITOR 4: Checking oracle ----- 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚨🚨🚨 
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out whether the test case provided by the competitor is correct or not. Let's start by understanding what the function is supposed to do.

The function takes an array of numbers and returns how many elements meet two conditions: first, the number must be greater than 10, and second, both the first and last digits of the number must be odd (1,3,5,7,9).

Looking at the test case given:

Input: [15, -73, 14, -15]
Expected result: 1

Let me break down each element in the input.

1. 15:
   - Is it greater than 10? Yes.
   - First digit is 1 (odd), last digit is 5 (also odd). So this should count.

2. -73:
   - The number is negative, but when considering digits, do we take the absolute value? I think so because otherwise, the first digit would be '-' which isn't a digit.
   - Absolute value of -73 is 73.
   - First digit is 7 (odd), last is 3 (also odd).
   - So this should count as well. But wait, the number itself must be greater than 10. The original number is -73, which is less than 10? Wait no: -73 is less than 10 because it's negative and has two digits. But wait, numbers greater than 10 would exclude any negatives if we're considering their actual value. Or does the condition apply to the absolute value?

Wait, the requirement says "the number is greater than 10". So for negative numbers, like -73, which is less than 10, they wouldn't count because they don't satisfy n > 10.

So in this case, -73 doesn't meet the first condition. It's not greater than 10; it's negative and thus less than 10.

3. 14:
   - Greater than 10? Yes.
   - First digit is 1 (odd), last is 4 (even). So both digits aren't odd, so this shouldn't count.

4. -15:
   - Number is -15, which is less than 10, so it doesn't meet the first condition. Even if we consider absolute value for digits, since it's not greater than 10, it's excluded.

So in the input list, only 15 meets both conditions. The test case expects a result of 1, which matches this analysis. Therefore, the oracle is correct.
</think>

The test case provided has an input array [15, -73, 14, -15] and expects the function to return 1. Upon analyzing each element:

- 15 meets both conditions (greater than 10, first digit 1 and last digit 5 are odd).
- -73 is less than 10, so it doesn't count.
- 14's last digit is even.
- -15 is less than 10.

Thus, the correct result is indeed 1. The test case's oracle is accurate.

{
    "judgement": true,
    "old_oracle": "assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));",
    "new_oracle": "assertEquals(1, Specialfilter.specialfilter(nums));",
