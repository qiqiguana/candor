<p>Mapping and site management.</p>

<p>This package began as an experimental package.  Even I wasn't sure
if it would turn out to be feasible or useful, so the design evolved
out of working code, which isn't often the best way to go about it.
So my next task is a complete refactoring this package.  As a
blueprint, here's what I'd like corina.map / corina.site design to
look like:</p>

<h3>Package</h3>

<p>The packages corina.map and corina.site should be merged.  Even I'm
not sure exactly what the line between them is, or was.  The new
package name should be the same as the name of the feature:
corina.atlas.</p>

<h3>Base Classes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Location* (mutable or immutable?)
  <li>Site* (public interface: Site.getSite(code), etc.)
  <li>SiteFile* (stores sites in a file)
  <li><i>Deprecated:</i> SiteDB (merge into Site or SiteFile)
  <li><i>Future:</i> SiteDatabase (stores sites in an RDBMS)
  <li>SiteInfoDialog*
  <li>SiteNotFoundException*
  <li>SitePrinter* (<i>Rename to:</i> SiteListPrinter)
  <li>Country*
  <li>CountryPopup
  <li>CountryDialog
</ul>

<h3>The Layers</h3>

<p>Since it takes a non-trivial amount of time (>50ms) to draw the
entire map, and there's a lot of drawing code, it's split into a bunch
of layers.  In use, each layer is asked to draw itself to a buffer,
and the buffers are composited as they're ready.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Layer
  <li>GridlinesLayer
  <li>LegendLayer
  <li>MapLayer
  <li>SitesLayer
</ul>

<h3>The Projections</h3>

<p>The Location-to-Point mapping is fast and simple, and also
something the user might want to be able to change.  Plus there are
lots of standard ones they'll expect.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Projection*
  <li>RectangularProjection
  <li>SphericalProjection
</ul>

<h3>High-Level Views</h3>

<ul>
  <li>AtlasWindow* (a window with tabs for the map and the sites)
  <li>MapPanel (need a separate MapComponent?)
  <li>SiteListPanel
</ul>

<h3>Low-Level Map Data</h3>

<ul>
  <li>MapFile
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li><i>Deprecated:</i> Lock (move to <code>corina.util</code>)
  <li><i>Deprecated:</i> Vector3 (internal to SphericalProjection)
</ul>

<p>* Public class.</p>
