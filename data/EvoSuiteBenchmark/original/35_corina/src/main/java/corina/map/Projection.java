/**
   A projection from Locations (latitude, longitude) to Points (x, y).

   <h2>Using Projections</h2>

   <p>Projection is abstract.  To make a Projection, call Projection.makeProjection(view).</p>

   <p>The View you make your Projection with never changes.  If you want to do some projections
   on a different View, make a new Projection.</p>
 
   <p>To use a Projection, use p.project() and p.unproject().  For performance reasons
   (they get called so many times) they don't return new objects, but get passed both
   input and output objects.</p>

   <h2>Writing a Projection</h2>
 
   <p>To write a new Projection, you just need to write a constructor, and project() and
   unproject() methods.  See RectangularProjection for an example.</p>
 
   <p>When drawing a map, project() is called thousands of times per map, with
   possibly several maps per second.  It should be as fast as possible.  Don't
   allocate any new objects in project(): it'll swamp the GC, and performance
   will suffer.</p>

   <p>(You don't need to worry as much about unproject().  It should still be as fast
   as possible, but it's not called nearly as frequently, so performance is not quite
   as critical.  For example, when the user drags or double-clicks on the map,
   unproject() is called just once to figure out where the mouse event was.)</p>

   <h2>Left To Do</h2>
   <p>(From most important to least.)</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Switch from Point3D to Point; Point3D should be internal to the spherical projection
     <li>javadoc the View object
     <li>Let me pick which projection makeProjection() returns
     <li>Cache projections in makeProjection()
     <li>My view field used to be protected; should it be?
   </ul>

     who uses project()?
     generally:
     - all the layers
     - all the tools
     - all the projections
     - MapFile, MapPanel
     specifically:
     - GridlinesLayer.java (no issues)
     - LegendLayer.java (no issues)
     - MapFile.java
     - MapLayer.java
     - MapPanel.java
     - Projection.java
     - RectangularProjection.java
     - SitesLayer.java
     - SphericalProjection.java
     - tools/ArrowTool.java
     - tools/HandTool.java
     - tools/RulerTool.java
     - tools/ZoomInTool.java
     - tools/ZoomOutTool.java
     this would be a great application of CVS.  check out a new copy, change project()
     interface, start changing things.  when done, check in everything at once.  if
     something screws up, just delete the folder.
