Tools for working with a map.

<p>Each tool has an icon, a cursor, a name, and defines some mouse behavior.
For example, the Hand tool scrolls the map when it's dragged on the map panel.
The ToolBox class (a JToolBar) provides the standard set of tools.</p>

<h2>Left to do:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Variable names in Tool are cryptic: p, b, etc.
  <li>Should Tool be an interface?
  <li>Document (JavaDoc) them all
  <li>I haven't decided whether it should be vertical or horizontal,
      so vertical/horizontal orientation should exist in exactly one place
  <li>Zoom in/out tools maybe shouldn't exist
</ul>
