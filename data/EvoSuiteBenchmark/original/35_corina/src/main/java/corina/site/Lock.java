/**
   A file locking mechanism, requiring nothing beyond what is provided
   by Java 1.1.  This uses the atomicity guaranteed by
   <code>File.createNewFile()</code>.  (The lockfile it creates for a
   file called "Data" would be called "Data - locked".  If Corina gets
   wedged, you can delete it by hand.)

   <p>It's appropriate for a relatively low-utilization fileserver
   where one filesystem is shared by multiple users.  For lock a
   single file in one JVM, use class methods and members, not the
   filesystem; for heavy-duty locking, use <a
   href="http://www.postgresql.org/">a real database</a> (which is
   more robust, and probably higher performance).</p>

   <p>Please do <em>not</em> write a native version of this.  Java's
   <code>createNewFile()</code> method guarantees atomicity, and it
   will work on any platform, so (for example) Mac and Windows
   workstations using a shared folder will all be able to do locking
   together correctly.  And creating a zero-length file will almost
   certainly be cached, so performance isn't really an issue.</p>
