/**
   A floating (previously misnamed "floating-point") index; each
   point on the index is the mean of some number of data points (the
   window) around that data point.

   <p>The "window" attribute is the number of years around this point
   to average.  The default is 11, meaning each value x[i] will be
   replaced by the mean of x[i-5], x[i-4], ..., x[i-1], x[i], x[i+1],
   ..., x[i+4], x[i+5].</p>
