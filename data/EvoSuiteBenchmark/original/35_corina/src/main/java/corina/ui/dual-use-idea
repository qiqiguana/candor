docbook needs:

	<shortcut>
		<keycombo><keycap>control</keycap> <keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>
	</shortcut>

or, in a table:

        <row>
          <entry>Undo</entry>
          <entry>
            <shortcut>
	      <keycombo><keycap>control</keycap> <keycap>Z</keycap></keycombo>
	    </shortcut>
          </entry>
          <entry>Undo last change</entry>
          <entry></entry>
        </row>

and in a properties file it's something like:

       undo = Can't Undo [accel Z]

so, all of the things it has are:

    -- "accel Z"		("control Z" is generated)
    -- "Undo" 			(action, for manual)
    -- "Undo last change"	(description, for manual)
    -- ""    	  		(reference, for manual; the id of a section/chapter)
    -- "Can't Undo"		(default text)
    -- false  			(default active/inactive?)

though, the docbook puts these in a table, by menu.  so the source must have a list by menu, at least, also.

can i use two xslt files, one to generate an xml file for docbook, and one to generate java code?

<menu id="file"><title>File</title>
	<menuitem id="open">
		<title>Open...</title>
		<shortcut>accel O</shortcut>
		<description>Open a sample</description>
		<reference>samples</reference>
		<!-- active defaults to true -->
		<!-- label defaults to title -->
	</menuitem>
</menu>

one of these per language?
