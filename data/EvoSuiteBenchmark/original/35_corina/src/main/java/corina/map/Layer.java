  strategy: (already implemented, i think.  more or less)
  -- create a set of layers when mappanel is created
  -- on paintComponent(g),
  ---- draw all clean layers
  ---- if there isn't a worker thread running, start one
  -- worker thread:
  ---- dirty all layers
  ---- for each layer, update() it, then invalidate() the mappanel

  issues:
  -- the buffer never gets resized!  how/where can i resize it?
     -- in update(), look at Projection.View.size.  if it's different, re-c't buf.
  -- what if the worker thread is doing something slow, and i want to start drawing again?

  perf:
  -- should i composite all of them into a final buf, once they're all done?
     -- (might be especially useful on win32 where double-buf isn't the default)

/**
   A layer of things to draw on a map.

   <p>Drawing the map in layers serves two purposes.  First, that's conceptually how
   maps are drawn.  You have boundaries, labels, a scale, and gridlines which are all
   drawn on top of each other, so it makes sense to separate them in code with a common
   interface.  Second, some layers take a while to draw, so the perceived performance
   of the map is much better if individual layers are drawn to the screen as they
   become available.</p>

   <p>To write a Layer, you just need to extend Layer and write a draw(Graphics2D, Projection)
   method.</p>

   <p>To use a Layer, call update(Projection) with the Projection you want it to have.
   (This could take a while to return.)  When that's finished, the buffer will contain
   the requested image; get it with getBuffer() and draw it to the screen.  If, while
   it's updating, you decide you don't want it, just call stop().  You can then call
   update() with a different Projection.</p>

   <p>To draw a Layer to a special Graphics2D (like an SVGGraphics2D), you can call
   draw(Graphics2D, Projection) yourself.</p>
