<p>Store dendro data a relational database (using JDBC).</p>

<p>Advantages over using files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>faster to browse (summarize)
  <li>more reliable (atomic transactions)
  <li>handles multiple users better (concurrency)
</ul>

<p>Uses JDBC for access.  You need to provide your own JDBC driver,
though.  (I've done testing with the pure-Java Postgres one, and it
works great.  I've also tried some memory-only ones, like HSQLDB, and
they work fine, too.)</p>

<p>The following parts are done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>open a connection to the database
  <li>see if there's a Corina database here
  <li>create the Corina schema here
  <li>given a Sample, put it in the database
  <li>given an ID in the database, get a Sample out
</ul>

<p>Sounds pretty spiffy, huh?  It's not yet usable, though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the low-level stuff probably isn't bulletproof yet

  <li>on that note, there are no unit tests for it

  <li>there are high-level issues, too: copy a folder to the database,
  but you still need to keep the non-Corina files around

  <li>Corina seems to be moving into the direction of "everything's a
  sample, a graph, or a crossdate"; corina.db can't store graphs or
  crossdates

  <li>it's not very usable yet; in theory, you should be able to add
  an iTunes-like data source, and click away, but it's not there yet

  <li>what would make it really usable is to hook it up to Rendezvous
  (jrendezvous.jar) so it can find your data automatically; this may
  be RDBMS-specific, though

  <li>if users are going to use it, it'll need to be able to download
  and link/load the proper driver automatically; at most, the user
  should have to fill out a form stating (1) what database it is (like
  "Oracle"), (2) where it is (e.g., an IP address, and possibly port),
  and (3) some authentication (username and password).

  <li>that (and probably the entire "browser" abstraction, eventually)
  will require a generic "data source" interface which has both
  filesystem and database (and FTP, and "smart lists", and bookmark
  lists, and ...) implementations, i.e., a bit of refactoring
</ul>

<h2>Sample Queries</h2>

<p>Here are some queries I'm using to test the database:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get title/range for samples of at least 100 years

<pre>
SELECT m.title, m.start, m.stop, m.span
FROM metadata m
WHERE m.span > 100
GROUP BY span, stop, start, title;
</pre>

      <li>count the total number of measurements
<pre>
SELECT sum(span)
FROM metadata;
</pre>

      <li>count the number of samples
<pre>
SELECT count(sid)
FROM metadata;
</pre>

      <li>show all the samples saved by "Joe"
<pre>
SELECT m.title, m.author
FROM metadata m
WHERE m.author LIKE '%Joe%'
GROUP BY title, author;
</pre>

      <li>all oak samples
<pre>
SELECT m.title
FROM metadata m
WHERE m.species LIKE '%uercus%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%QUERCUS%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%oak%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%Oak%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%OAK%'
GROUP BY species;
</pre>

      <li>all oak samples over 300 years long
<pre>
SELECT m.title, m.span
FROM metadata m
WHERE (m.species LIKE '%uercus%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%QUERCUS%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%oak%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%Oak%'
    OR m.species LIKE '%OAK%')
    AND m.span > 300
GROUP BY span, title;
</pre>

      <li>what's the longest chronology we have?
<pre>
SELECT m.title, m.span
FROM metadata m
WHERE m.span = (
    SELECT max(span)
    FROM metadata
)
</pre>

      <li>for each site, number of samples, and longest sample
<pre>
SELECT m.site, count(m.site), max(m.span)
FROM metadata m
GROUP BY 1;
</pre>

</ul>

<h2>Smart lists</h2>

Smart lists can be simply SELECT calls, but they can also be
implemented on database sources as VIEWs of the metadata table:

<pre>
CREATE VIEW long_oak
AS SELECT * FROM metadata WHERE span > 500 AND species LIKE 'oak'
GROUP BY span;
</pre>

Then the view <code>long_oak</code> looks just like another database
table to anybody wishing to select from it.  It uses the same
<code>data</code> and <code>elements</code> tables as the standard
<code>metadata</code> table does.
