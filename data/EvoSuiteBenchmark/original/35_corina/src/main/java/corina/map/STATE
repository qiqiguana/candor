brain dump, friday 6:05pm: [pretty much obsolete now]

-- i'm working on making the map redrawing use threads for responsiveness
-- in order to do that, i'm moving all the drawing from MapPanel
   methods to Layer classes
-- i got 3 of the big 4 done, leaving only SitesLayer not done: it's a
   huge section of MapFrame, with many public methods (!)
-- i also need to refactor SiteList, since it will never be used in
   its current form; it needs to present a very simple interface to
   the user (a list in a dialog), and a very simple interface to the
   map (draw all visible sites, add/remove site)
-- (to the side: i need to extract svg-export and printing somewhere,
   perhaps into the same class, like MapExporter, but that's not quite
   so urgent)

tasks up next:
-- make SiteList into something usable
-- move drawing code into SitesLayer
-- simplify MapPanel into "draw all these layers"
-- add threading to make MapPanel responsive

********************************************************************************

idea:
-- format for crossdates (and indexes?) requires the user to type
   something like "0.00"
-- why?  isn't there a simpler way?
-- the only things the user will possibly want to change are:
---- draw preceding zero (usually yes -- ever no?)
---- number of decimal places (let them set this)
---- draw as percentage? (usually const for cross; allow disabling?)
-- so, instead of text strings in the prefs, a simpler way would be to
   add a menu to the crosdate window:

  Format -- better: to the bottom of the View menu
   (*) 0.0
   ( ) 0.00
   ( ) 0.000
   ( ) 0.0000

   [ ] as % -- enabled for trend, weiserjahre, disabled for others

-- would zero decimal places be acceptable for crossdates?  ah, but
   that's 2 sig figs.  hmm...
-- would users ever want PPT?

-- if i'm using floats, more than 7 decimal places has no meaning; but
   since most of my input data has only about 3 sig figs, does even 4
   decimal places have any meaning?  hmm...  if that's true, it's my
   obligation to not allow more sig figs to be displayed.

how about just listing the %s, too?
  (*) 0.0
  ( ) 0.00
  ( ) 0.000
  ( ) 0.0000
  ( ) 0%
  ( ) 0.0%
  ( ) 0.00%
  ( ) 0.000%

BRAIN DUMP, monday night / tuesday morning:
-- really need to get that site list working for the map
-- also: thinking about higher-level i/o; can't corina/tucson/etc. be consolidated?
-- (compile-time is fine...)

one idea: %y=year, %v=value, %c=count, %i=inc, %d=dec

   SampleWriter.writeData(" %6y   %5v %5v %5v %5v ...\n") -- keeps track of years, etc.
   .writeYear() -- data year, count year, ??
   w = new SampleWriter(s, bw);
   w.writeMeta("title");
   w.write("\n");
   ...
   w.write(";DATA\n");
   w.writeYear();
options:
	- writeYear()
	- write(YEAR) (symbol)
	- write("@y") (escaped)

-- still optimistic about "one format for both reading and writing"
