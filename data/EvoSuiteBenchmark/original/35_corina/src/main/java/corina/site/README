What's wrong with this package?

-- it's 3 separate things, all mushed into one:
    -- it's a mapfile loader (earth.rez -- rez format), with a cache, etc.
    -- it's a map/site renderer, both to-screen and to-paper
    -- it's a database of sites

-- it doesn't have facilities for using a different (e.g., hardware) renderer
    -- is this even feasible without a re-organization?

-- pure-event system doesn't work well for lat/long lines
    -- just draw them
