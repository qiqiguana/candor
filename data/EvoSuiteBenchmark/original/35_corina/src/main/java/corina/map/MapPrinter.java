/**
   Print maps to a high-resolution printer.

   <p>This class implements Printable, so to use it, all you need to do is
   make a new one with

 <pre>
 Printable p = new MapPrinter(view, format);
 </pre>

   and pass that to Java's printing system.</p>

   <p>The Java graphics/printing system has a weird limitation: all of the
   drawing primitives only get you to point (1/72") resolution.  For most
   printing jobs (like a page of text), this is fine.  But our line maps
   have quite a bit more detail, and if each point is snapped to the nearest
   1/72" on the page, it looks really bad.</p>

   <p>The solution here is to make a new View, based on the View that we're
   passed, only with a larger area and zoomed in more, and then use
   Graphics2D's scale() call.  Then it all turns out ok.  (The only downside
   is that fixed-size things like the scale box become smaller, but that's
   much better than the alternative.  It could also be fixed, with some work.)

   <h2>Left to do:</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Why does the c'tor need a PageFormat, if print() takes one, too?
     <li>Make it accept a Projection, too?  Aah, no, Projection is made from a View.  Need to pass a type-of-Projection.
     <li>The user's SitesLayer might have something different showing, so we'll need to pass that in, too.
         (Can I use the same layers they're already using?)
     <li>Zooming in more isn't perfect (legend gets smaller, etc.).  What I need is higher-resolution
         maps.  Is that hard to do?
     <li>Bug?: I set the stroke before drawing the layers, but don't the layers set their own strokes?
   </ul>
