/**
   This is the interface which all file formats must implement.

   <p>A file format which implements this interface should not have
   any object state.  That is, the methods, though they're object
   methods, should behave more like class methods -- one Filetype
   object may be used for multiple samples.  (They're object
   methods simply because Java doesn't allow class methods in
   interfaces.)</p>

   <p>A load() method should <i>not</i> call close() when it's done
   loading, especially if it couldn't load a sample from the reader,
   for performance reasons; though if it does, it will still work.  If
   a load() fails, Corina resets the stream to the start, and tries
   again with a different loader.  (If the steam was already closed, a
   new one will be automatically opened, but this is less efficient.
   SAX, for example, always closes its streams.)</p>

   <p>The save() method doesn't need to close the writer, but it
   doesn't matter if it does.  The writer will be closed immediately
   after use, and closing a writer twice has no effect.</p>
