File formats for dendro files (Tucson, TSAP, ...).

<h2>How to load/save files normally</h2>

WRITEME: how to load/save files normally

<h2>How Corina implements loading/saving</h2>

WRITEME: how corina implements this loading/saving, so you can tweak
it (include Filetype here?) -- how it picks a format for loading, how
it picks a format for saving, how to export to a different format

<h2>How to write a new Filetype</h2>

WRITEME: how to extend Filetype on your own so corina can load/save
other formats

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>Filetypes should be able to report which metadata fields they
support.  That way, for example, if you set your default filetype to
Tucson, there could be some visual indication that most of the fields
you're filling out won't be saved.</p>

<h2>Formats</h2>

WRITEME: the actual formats: check the javadoc for whether they're
load-save, load-only, or save-only.
