      i hate this class.  i'd much prefer to simply have a
      disposeIfNotSaved(SaveableDoc) method, which any Frame could use
      to override dispose(), so i wouldn't need to care about XFrames
      and close().  but i can't get that to work.  actually, i had
      incredible difficulties getting anything to work, because the
      behavior of dispose() and windowClosing(), etc., isn't very well
      documented.  so: please refactor me, but i don't know how.

      -- this looks like a perfect example of paul graham's argument
      against OOPS.  i'd much rather have the ability to add these
      features to windows as i like, rather than having the union of
      all of them to take or leave.
