       a help window, it jumps to a specified page of the manual, as
       specified by the <code>id</code> argument.  This corresponds to
       the "id" attribute of the DocBook source, so a chapter
       specified by

       <pre>
         &lt;chapter id="crossdating"&gt;

       <p>Use this method whenever possible, instead of simply adding an
       action to call <code>showHelp()</code>, because it's much more
       helpful to show help that's most relevant to what the user is
       doing right now.</p>

       "trouble in HelpActionListener", that's straight out of JavaHelp.
       JavaHelp printed that message (instead of throwing an exception),
       not Corina.  It usually means it was asked to go to a section of
       the manual by an ID that doesn't exist.</p>
