/**
   A particular View of the map.  A View consists of:

   <ul>
     <li>The center (latitude and longitude)
     <li>The zoom factor (1.0 is "normal")
     <li>The size (in pixels for the screen, or points for the printer)
   </ul>

   <p>A View object is mutable.  A window showing a map that the user can manipulate has
   a View associated with it, which gets changed as the user plays with the map.
   To draw the map, Corina first makes a Projection using the current View, and
   then uses that Projection to map Locations to Points.</p>
