browser should also remember:
-- column visibility, order		corina.browser.fields		DONE
-- sort field				corina.browser.sort		DONE
					corina.browser.reverse		DONE
-- relative sizes of columns		corina.browser.sizes	"10 20 50"?
-- position on screen			corina.browser.position	"(x0 y0) (x1 y1)"?
-- folder				corina.browser.folder		DONE

things it should do:
-- when you add a field, it forgets old column sizes
-- ... and ordering
-- unmeas/end appears to sort stringwise, even putting nulls first
	-- because one is a string?  ouch...  put numbers first?
-- sapwood count is ints, but it sorts low-to-high (?)
-- lower-case 'y' isn't recognized as "Yes" in reconciled field
	-- (likewise for 's' = "section" as a type)
-- after row.load(), searching should check just that row

things i want to do, like from a context menu (or a file menu!):
-- graph a bunch of things						DONE
-- n-by-n crossdate?  grid?
-- make a new sum							DONE
