(a modeless dialog)

==============================================[x]=
Display the following sites on this map:

  [ ][Code][Title                ][Type    ][v]
  |x | ABC |                      |         | |
  |x | DEF |                      |         | |
  |x |     |                      |         | |
  |  |     |                      |         | |
  |x |     |                      |         | |

==================================================

- open questions:
-- once you've done a search, how do you say "find next"?
-- if i simply keep 2 lists, how will i compute show[i]?  a.contains(b[i]) is O(n), which
   i don't want to run O(n) times.

- idea 1: type-to-select searches current-sort column
- idea 2: type-to-select searches any visible text

- won't allow any editing here: just showing which are visible

- no ok/cancel buttons: when you check something, it appears/disappears on the map immediately

TODO:

- click on header to sort by column (stably)
- right-click on header, or any click on [v] corner, lets you add/remove columns
  - columns: id, code, name, country, type, species, altitude, latitude, longitude, comments
  - [v] can look like a non-editable jcombobox with text "" (?)
- visible(checkbox) and code/title(both?) fields must always be visible

- cmd-A to select all, cmd-shift?-A to deselect all, of course

- watch!  sign up for all event listeners on the sitedb, and update the view accordingly

- sort-column, visible-columns (+order) should be the same if i select view->select sites again
-- i'll need to store them, either with the mapframe, or as a pref?

- steal "forest/medieval/ancient" icons from peter's old whatever-it-was paper?
-- forest=tree (duh)
-- medieval=castle (just one tower, like a rook?)
-- ancient=pyramid?
- do these in SVG!  (render to PNG at compile-time is fine, but start moving to SVG)

- feature: want to be able to say "all within <foo> km of <bar>"
  - more generic: add "distance from <foo>" column!
  - need "Make 'Distance' column from this site" feature
  - need "Show/Hide Selected Sites" features

- keep the checkbox on the left, always

- it would be really nice to have "%d sites" / "%d sites visible" labels

- use alternating-colored-rows, vertical-gridlines?
