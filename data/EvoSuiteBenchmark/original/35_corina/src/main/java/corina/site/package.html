A list of Sites.

<p>Each sample may belong to one Site, which correlates to the folder
it's in.  This package attempts to provide a database-like interface
to this file.</p>

<!-- WRITEME: a screenshot of a finder window with "Site Database", "ZKB", "AYA", etc., perhaps -->
<!-- or at least a small folder listing, showing the directory structure -->

<h2>Site</h2>

<p>Site has the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name: the name of the site; required</li>
  <li>Code: an alphabetic code, usually a 3-letter string; required</li>
  <li>ID: an identification number, usually a 3-digit number (legacy)</li>
  <li>Country: the country this site is in</li>
  <li>Type: forest, medieval, ancient, or unknown</li>
  <li>Species: ...</li>
  <li>Location: latitude and longitude</li>
  <li>Altitude: in meters</li>
  <li>Comments: any comments you have about this site</li>
  <li>Lists of masters and nonfits</li>
  <li>Folder: the folder which stores samples from this site; every sample in this folder is considered to be from this site</li>
<!-- webcams? -->
</ul>

<!-- WRITEME: sample values, for each of the above -->

<h2>File</h2>

<p>The file is in an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>-based
format.  The overall structure of the file looks like:</p>

<pre style="background: #ddd">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

&lt;sitedb&gt;

   &lt;!-- list of all site records here --&gt;

&lt;/sitedb&gt;
</pre>

<p>Each site record looks like:</p>

<pre style="background: #ddd">
   &lt;site&gt;
      &lt;country&gt;TU&lt;/country&gt;
      &lt;code&gt;ZKB&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Zonguldak, Karabuk&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;species&gt;&lt;/species&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;filename&gt;&lt;/filename&gt;
      &lt;location&gt;&lt;/location&gt;
      &lt;comments&gt;&lt;/comments&gt;
   &lt;/site&gt;
</pre>

<!-- WRITEME: describe each field (type, location, etc.), order/indenting, encoding, ... -->

<p>The file is called "Site Database", and lives in the same folder as
all of your data folders.  (The lockfile, whose presense indicates
that it's being accessed, is called "Site Database - locked", in the
same folder.)</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>The site database also has an event framework, if you want to be
notified when a site changes any of its info.  For example, a map can
register itself to watch for <code>siteMoved</code> events.  Then if
another user decides to adjust the position of a site, it's automatically
re-positioned on your map.</p>

<p>Each of the setters fires the necessary events automatically.
Simply call
<code>setLocation(newLocation)</code> and everybody who needs to be notified will.</p>

<p>To watch for events, add yourself as a listener
with <code>addSiteDBListener()</code>, and implement either
the <code>SiteDBListener</code> interface, or extend
the <code>SiteDBAdapter</code> class.</p>

<!-- WRITEME: make these clickable -->
<!-- WRITEME: explain why the listeners are on the whole database, not one site -->
<!-- WRITEME: think about problem of firing events for generic database-changed events
     but i'll only have a small number of listeners, so firing every possible combination
     wouldn't be impossible -->

<h2>Locking</h2>

<p>The class <code>Lock</code> defines a simple file locking system.  Because
the site database will initially be stored in a file in a shared folder used
by many users, we don't want to take the risk of more than one user writing
to it at the same time.  Or somebody reading from it while somebody else is
still writing to it, and seeing only a partial file.</p>

<p>Lock has only 2 static methods: <code>acquire()</code>
and <code>release()</code>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>For displaying Site information for users,
use <code>SiteInfo</code>.  It displays all of the information for a
given site to the user.  If he changes it, it's updated in the
database (and on disk).  If it's changed in another part of the
program or by another user, it's updated in this window.</p>

<!-- WRITEME: make this clickable -->
<!-- WRITEME: put a small screenshot in the margin, so they see what we mean -->

<p>For displaying a list of all Sites, use <code>SiteList</code>.  It
shows all sites, allows keyboard navigation, and if you double-click a
site, shows you a <code>SiteInfo</code> window for that site.  You can
also add and delete sites from the list.</p>

<!-- WRITEME: make this clickable -->
<!-- WRITEME: put a small screenshot in the other margin -->

<p>You can also use lower-level modifications yourself.  For example,
on a map you might want to drag a site, and need to be able to set its
location without having the user type it in.  For this, you would use:

<ul>
  <li><code>s = SiteDB.getSite(...)</code> to search for a Site object,</li>

  <li><code>s.getName()</code>, and other getters, to get info about the site, and</li>

  <li><code>s.setName(...)</code>, and other setters, to set info about the site</li>
</ul>

If you're displaying site information, you should also register a SiteDBListener
so your display updates when the data changes.</p>

<p>Note that you never need to explicitly "load" or "save" the site
database.  The first time you call getSite(), it gets loaded.  Whenever it
gets changed, it is automatically reloaded.  Whenever you change a value,
it is automatically saved.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>Since Corina is moving to real database storage, the Site Database
should simply be a table in that schema.  It should still be available
as a file, though - it should probably be attached to a each
Source.</p>

<p>Since it's being loaded and saved so many times by so many people,
it might be a good idea to keep a backup of this file, perhaps called
"Site Database Backup", just in case something goes wrong.  Before
saving the file, Corina should rename the old file to that.</p>

<p>Since there's so much I/O to this one file, and it's not very small
file (ours is about 170 KB now), perhaps I should allow it to be
compressed.  It's probably not too hard to check for <a
href="http://www.gzip.org/">GZip</a> compression, and automatically
compress/decompress.  I'm just not sure if it's worth it.</p>

<!-- NOTE: according to /etc/magic, gzip files start with \037\213,
     which is super-easy to check for, especially if the alternative
     is a normal XML file, or "less-than, ?xml..." -->
