/**
    A basis function for fitting data points to, using
    least-squares.  If an object implements this interface,
    <code>Solver.leastSquares()</code> can be used to fit it to data.

    <p>For example, if you want to fit some data to a quadratic,
    your basis vector would be [ 1 x x<sup>2</sup> ], and your code
    might look like:</p>

<pre>
    public double[] f(double x) {
        return new double[] { 1, x, x*x };
    }
</pre>
