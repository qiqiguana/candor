Problems with l10n in Corina:

- Lots of things aren't localized yet, especially error messages
(which should probably go away or be rewritten).

- Properties files are always UTF-8.  This is ok for English and
German, where I've used only ASCII (and Java Unicode escapes), but
I better figure out how to do real UTF-8 in xemacs soon.

- It better be cleverer than the metadata.  Lots of stuff in the
metadata properties file is universal, and doesn't belong there.

- Apparently Java provides no support for localizing mnemonics and
accelerators.  So for every key that needs such things:

	word = Translation
	word_key = T
	word_acc = control T

(Fortunately Java can parse "control T" into a KeyEvent.)

- Some parts of the existing properties files aren't actually used, or
are otherwise poorly organized.  Clean 'em up.

- Use correct quotes!  According to Unicode, U+201C and U+201D are the
proper curvy-quotes, and U+2019 is an apostrophe (especially important
in French).  But I don't know if Windows supports this...
