## ISO 3166-1 country codes (with TU=Turkey)## Corina uses ISO 3166-1, with one exception: Turkey is "TU", by# convention (due to a very old goof).  This doesn't really cause any# problems, since TU isn't used for anything else.  (Though it might# if some other program expects pure ISO 3166-1.)## This file might ought to be localized in the future.  (You probably# only need to do the countries that will actually be used.  For the# Cornell lab, that means Europe through the Middle East.)## If you want images of the flags, look at Flags of the World, with# URL http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/<x>/<xy>.gif, where# <xy> = 2-letter code, lower-case, <x> = first letter of <xy>, also# lower-case.  It would probably be a good idea to write a program# to grab all the flags, resize them to really-small, and build a# jar out of them.  (At 1-4KB each, that's probably 200-800K, at# full size; even at 128px across, it'll be 1/12 that, or maybe more# like 16-64K.)#AF = AfghanistanAL = AlbaniaDZ = AlgeriaAS = American SamoaAD = AndorraAO = AngolaAI = AnguillaAQ = AntarcticaAG = Antigua and BarbudaAR = ArgentinaAM = ArmeniaAW = ArubaAU = AustraliaAT = AustriaAZ = AzerbaijanBS = BahamasBH = BahrainBD = BangladeshBB = BarbadosBY = BelarusBE = BelgiumBZ = BelizeBJ = BeninBM = BermudaBT = BhutanBO = BoliviaBA = Bosnia and HerzegovinaBW = BotswanaBV = Bouvet IslandBR = BrazilIO = British Indian Ocean TerritoryBN = Brunei DarussalamBG = BulgariaBF = Burkina FasoBI = BurundiKH = CambodiaCM = CameroonCA = CanadaCV = Cape VerdeKY = Cayman IslandsCF = Central African RepublicTD = ChadCL = ChileCN = ChinaCX = Christmas IslandCC = Cocos (Keeling) IslandsCO = ColombiaKM = ComorosCG = CongoCD = Congo, The Democratic Republic of theCK = Cook IslandsCR = Costa RicaCI = Cote D'IvoireHR = CroatiaCU = CubaCY = CyprusCZ = Czech RepublicDK = DenmarkDJ = DjiboutiDM = DominicaDO = Dominican RepublicTP = East TimorEC = EcuadorEG = EgyptSV = El SalvadorGQ = Equatorial GuineaER = EritreaEE = EstoniaET = EthiopiaFK = Falkland Islands (Malvinas)FO = Faroe IslandsFJ = FijiFI = FinlandFR = FranceGF = French GuianaPF = French PolynesiaTF = French Southern TerritoriesGA = GabonGM = GambiaGE = GeorgiaDE = GermanyGH = GhanaGI = GibraltarGR = GreeceGL = GreenlandGD = GrenadaGP = GuadeloupeGU = GuamGT = GuatemalaGN = GuineaGW = Guinea-BissauGY = GuyanaHT = HaitiHM = Heard Island and McDonald IslandsVA = Holy See (Vatican City State)HN = HondurasHK = Hong KongHU = HungaryIS = IcelandIN = IndiaID = IndonesiaIR = Iran, Islamic Republic ofIQ = IraqIE = IrelandIL = IsraelIT = ItalyJM = JamaicaJP = JapanJO = JordanKZ = KazakstanKE = KenyaKI = KiribatiKP = Korea, Democratic People's Republic ofKR = Korea, Republic ofKW = KuwaitKG = KyrgyzstanLA = Lao People's Democratic RepublicLV = LatviaLB = LebanonLS = LesothoLR = LiberiaLY = Libyan Arab JamahiriyaLI = LiechtensteinLT = LithuaniaLU = LuxembourgMO = MacauMK = Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic ofMG = MadagascarMW = MalawiMY = MalaysiaMV = MaldivesML = MaliMT = MaltaMH = Marshall IslandsMQ = MartiniqueMR = MauritaniaMU = MauritiusYT = MayotteMX = MexicoFM = Micronesia, Federated States ofMD = Moldova, Republic ofMC = MonacoMN = MongoliaMS = MontserratMA = MoroccoMZ = MozambiqueMM = MyanmarNA = NamibiaNR = NauruNP = NepalNL = NetherlandsAN = Netherlands AntillesNC = New CaledoniaNZ = New ZealandNI = NicaraguaNE = NigerNG = NigeriaNU = NiueNF = Norfolk IslandMP = Northern Mariana IslandsNO = NorwayOM = OmanPK = PakistanPW = PalauPS = Palestinian Territory, OccupiedPA = PanamaPG = Papua New GuineaPY = ParaguayPE = PeruPH = PhilippinesPN = PitcairnPL = PolandPT = PortugalPR = Puerto RicoQA = QatarRE = ReunionRO = RomaniaRU = Russian FederationRW = RwandaSH = Saint HelenaKN = Saint Kitts and NevisLC = Saint LuciaPM = Saint Pierre and MiquelonVC = Saint Vincent and the GrenadinesWS = SamoaSM = San MarinoST = Sao Tome and PrincipeSA = Saudi ArabiaSN = SenegalSC = SeychellesSL = Sierra LeoneSG = SingaporeSK = SlovakiaSI = SloveniaSB = Solomon IslandsSO = SomaliaZA = South AfricaGS = South Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsES = SpainLK = Sri LankaSD = SudanSR = SurinameSJ = Svalbard and Jan MayenSZ = SwazilandSE = SwedenCH = SwitzerlandSY = Syrian Arab RepublicTW = Taiwan, Province of ChinaTJ = TajikistanTZ = Tanzania, United Republic ofTH = ThailandTG = TogoTK = TokelauTO = TongaTT = Trinidad and TobagoTN = Tunisia# TR = TurkeyTU = TurkeyTM = TurkmenistanTC = Turks and Caicos IslandsTV = TuvaluUG = UgandaUA = UkraineAE = United Arab EmiratesGB = United KingdomUS = United StatesUM = United States Minor Outlying IslandsUY = UruguayUZ = UzbekistanVU = VanuatuVE = VenezuelaVN = Viet NamVG = Virgin Islands, BritishVI = Virgin Islands, U.S.WF = Wallis and FutunaEH = Western SaharaYE = YemenYU = YugoslaviaZM = ZambiaZW = Zimbabwe
