IFX Code generation tools. The CodeGenerator tool can be run using the "ant generate" target. This will generate a parallel source tree src-gen/ under the build root containing the IFX framework beans. The parallel source tree can be compiled with "ant compile-gen" which will build the classes under the build/ directory. The src-gen/ tree builds the org.sourceforge.ifx.framework.* package and its subpackages and obsoletes the partially complete manual implementation under the old src/org/sourceforge/ifx/framework/* tree.
