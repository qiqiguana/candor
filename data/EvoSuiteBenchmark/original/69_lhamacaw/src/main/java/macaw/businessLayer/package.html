Contains classes that represent business concepts in the system.  
Most of the classes will support three kinds of activities:
<ul>
<li> setting and getting properties that are expressed as form fields in the GUI
and as database fields in an underlying SQL database.
<li>
<li> validation code to determine when an instance of a model class contains errors. 
</li>
<li> code that detects when some property has changed.  This is used a lot in Macaw's
system for tracking changes made to a record by different users.
</li>
</ul>



<h2>Understanding the Business Concepts</h2>
A {@link macaw.businessLayer.Variable} represents a single type of data that has been 
uniformly gathered about each member in the NSHD study.  In most cases, a 
variable will describe some survey question and its associated results for 
each case study member.  Each variable is associated with a number of attributes 
such as 
<ul>
<li>a name (eg: "HT61") </li>
<li>a label (eg: height in 1961)</li>
<li>a year</li>
<li>question number and form of some survey</li>
<li>whether the answers were encoded electronically</li>
<li>
<li>start and stop column numbers that identify where in an ASCII text file
the results for the variable may be found</li>
<li>free text notes</li>
</ul>

<p>
These ideas are described more thoroughly in the {@link macaw.businessLayer.Variable} class.  
A Variable also has a number of other attributes which are represented as objects of
these classes:
<ul>
<li>{@link macaw.businessLayer.SupportingDocument}, which is a document that scientists can 
read to find out how results for a variable were determined.  For example, a PDF 
document called "Ethnicity Definitions" could describe how scientists recorded the 
ethnicity of someone from the study.
</li>
<li>{@link macaw.businessLayer.OntologyTerm}, which is a concept that is used to tag a variable 
so that the variable can be picked up in a search based on concepts and not by text phrases
that appear in fields of Variable classes. 
</li>
<li>{@link macaw.businessLayer.AliasFilePath}
</ul>
