Classes in this package were designed to migrate legacy data from SWIFT into Macaw.  To import
the data, you need to create a jar file for Macaw and run the main method for 
{@link macaw.swiftIntegration.ImportSWIFTDataIntoMacaw2}.  The volume of data to import is
such that you will probably not be able to run the application from Eclipse.  Eclipse takes
up a lot of memory and when it launches the migration program, you will eventually encounter
an Out of Memory error.  However, if you run {@link macaw.swiftIntegration.ImportSWIFTDataIntoMacaw2}
from the command line, it should work.
