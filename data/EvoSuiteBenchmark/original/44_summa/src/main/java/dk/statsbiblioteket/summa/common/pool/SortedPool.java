/**
* Maintains an ordered list of values, providing fast lookup based on position
* and lookup based on value. Additions and removals from the pool shifts
* positions in a deterministic manner.
* </p><p>
* SortedPools are not guaranteed to accept input before {@link #open} has been
* called.
* </p><p>
* null is not a permitted value for SortedPools. All values are unique, with
* regard to equals().
* </p><p>
* For persistence, the format of the pool is as follows:
* </p><p>
* [poolname].dat contains the values in implementation-specific format
* directly appended after each other.
* </p><p>
* [poolname].index contains the index-entries for the values in [poolname].dat.
* The entries are represented af longs, made up of length of the value followed
* by its position. {@link #POSITION_BITS} specify the amount of bits for position.
* The format of the file is as follows:<br />
* version (4 bytes)<br />
* entry-count (4 bytes)<br />
* index-entries (8 bytes * entry-count)<br />
* </p><p>
* Note: The position in the entries does not need to be increasing. It is up
*       to the implementation to be capable of determining when one value
*       ends and the next begins (e.g. use \n as delimiter for Strings).
