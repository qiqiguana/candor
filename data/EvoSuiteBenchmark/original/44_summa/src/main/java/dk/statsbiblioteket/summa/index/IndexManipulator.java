 * A manipulator is responsible for updating part of an index. This could be a
 * Lucene index, the persistent structure for Facets or SearchDescriptor.
 * If the specific part of the index is not initialized upon start, the
 * manipulator is responsible for the initialization.
 * </p><p>
 * Manipulators should not do anything active to any index, before the open-
 * method has been called.
 * </p><p>
 * Note that it is expected that readers of the index can connect to the index
 * at any time, so manipulators /must/ ensure that the persistent files are
 * kept in a readable state at all time.
 * </p><p>
 * Note: The field RecordID is mandatory for the searchable index (typically
 * Lucene). The index should be stored for debug reasons and must be indexed.
 * The RecordID is the unique identifier for the Record and thus one and only
 * one Document in a given index has any given RecordID.
