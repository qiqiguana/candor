<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<h3>Multi-volume handling.</h3>

<p>
    A flat and fairly simple layout is used for the database. The only moderately
complex pair is how multi-volumes are handled.</p>

<p>
    Multi-volumes has a parent and some children. Children can be parents too,
    but children can only have a single parent. At ingest time, parents does not
    always know their children and children does not always know their parent.
</p>

<p>
    The tricky part it to mark parents as updated when children change (or are
    added or removed) and to mark the children as not indexable if they have a
    parent.
</p>

<h3>Database fields</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>ID (String, max-length 255 chars)</dt>
    <dd>The unique ID for the record.</dd>
    <dt>BASE (String, max-length 31 chars)</dt>
    <dd>The base (origin) for the record.</dd>
    <dt>DELETED (Boolean)</dt>
    <dd>If true, the record should not be used for anything, except
        viewing.</dd>
    <dt>INDEXABLE (Boolean)</dt>
    <dd>If true, the record should be indexed. This is used together with
        multi-volumes (see below).</dd>
    <dt>DATA (Blob, max-size 50MB)</dt>
    <dd>The payload of the record.</dd>
    <dt>CTIME (Timestamp)</dt>
    <dd>Creation time for the record.</dd>
    <dt>MTIME (Timestamp)</dt>
    <dd>Modification time for the record.</dd>
    <dt>PARENT (String, max-length 255 chars)</dt>
    <dd>The ID of a parent. Parents need not be in the index at ingest time,
        neither at index time. If a parent is not existing, the PARENT-field
        will simply be ignored.</dd>
    <dt>CHILDREN (String, max-length 1000*256 chars)</dt>
    <dd>ID's of children. As with PARENT, children need not be present in the
        database. Children-ID's are separated by ',' (comma, no spaces).</dd>
    <dt>VALID (String, max-length 20 chars)</dt>
    <dd>The validation-state for the data. This can be one of the following:
        notValidated, valid and invalid.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>What happens when we do anything on the database?</h3>
<p>
    After a record has been added, changed or removed, a search for a parent for
    the record is performed. If the record has PARENT defined and the parent
    exist, that parent is used. Any record with CHILDREN that contains the ID
    for the new record is also defined to be a parent. Only the first parent
    is used (multiple parents are not supported at this time).
</p>
<p>
    If a parent is found, that parent is marked as changed (so that it will be
    re-ingested) by setting the MTIME to Now. The record (which is now
    determined to be a child) is maked with INDEXABLE=false. The ID for the
    record is added to the parent's CHILDREN, if it is not already present.
</p>
<p>
    After the parent is marked as changed, a search for grand-parents is
    started, marking any found grandparent changed. And so on. Parents which
    has a parent are also marked with INDEXABLE=false.
</p>

<h3>Requesting a record</h3>
<p>
    When the indexer or the viewer requests a record with children, these
    children are merged with the parent and returned as one. This is recursive,
    so the end-result might contain many merged records.
</p>

<h3>Ingesting a Record</h3>
<p>
    At ingest-time, a Record can be marked as either new, modified or deleted
    by the target-specific ingester.<br />
    New: ctime = mtime.<br />
    Modified: ctime is less than mtime (set ctime to 0).<br />
    Deleted: Same as Modified and with deleted set to true
