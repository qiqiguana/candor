This paper describes the use of SRTM data to derive drainage network and related products, suchas accumulated drainage areas and river lengths, with application to the Uruguay river basin. Six distinctDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) were used, varying the spatial resolution and applying the stream burningpre-processing technique. The main limitations of the DEM-derived drainage network refer to the incapacityof representing river meanders that are smaller than the pixel size and the problem of artificial sinuosity thatoccurs when the width of the river is larger than pixel side.</dc:description><dc:subject>Digital elevation model</dc:subject><dc:subject>hydrologic modeling</dc:subject><dc:subject>flow directions</dc:subject><dc:source>Revista Geográfica Acadêmica</dc:source><dc:publisher>Universidade Federal de Goiás</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:dd71292fa060de20e2733bb4ad441d1f</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T03:14:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>IDENTIFICAÇÃO DE DEFORMAÇÕES NEOTECTÔNICAS, ATRAVÉS DE IMAGEM SRTM, E SUA RELAÇÃO COM A GÊNESE DOS AREAIS -SUDOESTE DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL / IDENTIFICATION OF NEOTECTONIC DEFORMATIONS, THROUGH SRTM IMAGE, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GENESIS OF THE “AREAIS” – SOUTHWESTERN RIO GRANDE DO SUL</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.rga.ggf.br/index.php?journal=rga&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=35&amp;path%5B%5D=33</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=16787226&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=96</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Clódis de Oliveira Andrades Filho</dc:creator><dc:creator>Laurindo Antonio Guasselli</dc:creator><dc:creator>Dirce Maria Antunes Suertegaray</dc:creator><dc:description>This research seeks to assess possible neotectonic influence in the formation of sandization in southwest ofRio Grande do Sul.

It isinserted on the geological context of the Potiguar Basin with a high environmental sensitivity index. Themain geoenvironmental units are occupied by industrial activities as salt and oil industries and shrimp farms.This paper aims to describe the integration of radar (SRTM) and optical (LANDSAT 7 ETM+ and CBERS2-CCD) data to create images which enhance geomorphology and morphotectonic features from thearea, allowing a better environmental characterization. Altimetry, lineaments, drainage system and slopeinformation were obtained from SRTM data. RGB color images were created from the optical data withcontrast enhancement. This methodology is useful to support the understanding of the morphodynamicframework, and creating a good cartographic database which can be used on emergency plans on oilspills, and to optimize protections of the most sensitive environments.

In this perspective it’s necessary to evaluate theenvironmental vulnerabilities within the ecodynamical conception (Tricart, 1977), based on systems theory.One of the widely used evaluation methodologies, not only in the geographical environment, is the UniversalSoil Loss Equation (USLE), using maps to spatialize and quantify its factors. Whereas progress have beenmade in the generation of Remote Sensing products, through new sensors, this paper proposes the use ofSRTM elevation data to generate one of the USLE factors, the Lenght-Slope map. The studied area wascórrego Cachoeirinha watershed, located in the municipalities of Cáceres and Porto Estrela, Mato Grosso- Brazil. The implementation involved the drafting of rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, lenght-slope factor,crop/vegetation factor and support practices maps. These maps were combined in ArcGis, allowing thequantification of soil losses in the watershed and the determination of different fragility degrees, in conformitywith the classification proposed by UNESCO (1980). The LS map generated from SRTM revealed moredetails on the hillside shapes. It’s emphasized the greater agility to produce the soil loss maps, consequentlythe vulnerability, using SRTM.</dc:description><dc:subject>SRTM</dc:subject><dc:subject>USLE</dc:subject><dc:subject>length-slope factor</dc:subject><dc:subject>environmental fragility</dc:subject><dc:subject>córrego Cachoeirinha watershed / MT</dc:subject><dc:source>Revista Geográfica Acadêmica</dc:source><dc:publisher>Universidade Federal de Goiás</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:dbcd1e171aa5836e6c2fa794506352aa</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T03:21:02Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>USO DE DADOS SRTM COMO FERRAMENTA DE APOIO AOMAPEAMENTO GEOMORFOLÓGICO DE BACIA DE MÉDIOGRANDE PORTE / USE OF DADOS SRTM AS TOOL OF SUPPORT TO MAPPING GEOMORPHOLOGIC OF MEDIUM-BIG BASIN</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.rga.ggf.br/index.php?journal=rga&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=38&amp;path%5B%5D=35</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=16787226&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=138</dc:identifier><dc:creator>André Luiz Nascentes Coelho</dc:creator><dc:description>The present article has as objective detaches the main stages for production of the mapping geomorphologicof the basin of Doce river of 83.465 km², with the use of data SRTM (Shuttle Radar TopographyMission) and tools of GIS proposing a more detailed and updated classification of the basin in scale1:100.000.

Chem. 2006; 52:634–642). We found that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) were the most sensitive and universal mRNA markers of apoptosis in leukocytes. In order to define positive and negative responses, a synthetic RNA was spiked into the lysis buffer and the fold increase was calculated. As a result, 837/880 (95.1%) of data points stayed between 0.75 and 1.5 fold increase, and 874/880 (99.3%) were within 0.5–2.0 fold increase. When blood samples from 40 healthy adults were stimulated with 22 different drugs, more than 75% of the samples responded to bleomycin (1 μΜ), idarubicin (2 μΜ), vincristine (1 μΜ), daunorubicin (2 μΜ), cytarabine (10 μΜ), to induce p21 and/or PUMA mRNA, and approximately 25% showed no induction. Significant correlation was found between p21 and PUMA mRNA responses, and between daunorubicin and cytarabine, idarubicin, and vincristine for both p21 and PUMA. The quantification of drug-induced mRNA in whole blood will be considered as ex vivo, and is a suitable platform for biomarker screening as well as a model system for drug sensitivity tests in future.</dc:description><dc:subject>tailored medicine</dc:subject><dc:subject>gene expression</dc:subject><dc:subject>chemotherapy</dc:subject><dc:subject>biochemical resistant</dc:subject><dc:subject>biochemical markers</dc:subject><dc:subject>PUMA</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Blood Disorders</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:fe96e64ec21f8bba2ccbdb3b3e212787</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:09:02Z</datestamp><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>A Disease Mechanism Underlying Bleeding in Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=513</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11782269&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=13</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Shigeru Tsuboi</dc:creator><dc:description>The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is an X chromosome-linked immunodeficiency disorder. The most common symptom in WAS is bleeding. Several clinical investigations indicate that low platelet counts and defective platelet aggregation are the major causes of bleeding in WAS patients. However, the molecular bases underlying these defects are unclear. This study focuses on the molecular mechanism of defective platelet aggregation of WAS patients. The gene responsible for WAS encodes WAS protein (WASP). The mutations or deletion of WASP causes various functional defects in hematopoietic cells. We previously showed that binding of WASP to calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB) is required for activation of platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. I here demonstrate that blocking WASP binding to CIB reduces binding of talin to the β3 cytoplasmic tail, resulting in impaired activation of αIIbβ3. Impaired αIIbβ3 activation causes defective platelet aggregation, resulting in bleeding. This finding suggests a potential disease mechanism underlying bleeding seen in WAS patients.</dc:description><dc:subject>Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome</dc:subject><dc:subject>WASP</dc:subject><dc:subject>bleeding</dc:subject><dc:subject>platelet aggregation</dc:subject><dc:subject>αIIbβ3 activation</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Blood Disorders</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:5ce5e9986400a55fc5067ae529162285</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:11:39Z</datestamp><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Long Term Results after 3 Courses of ABVD Plus Subtotal Nodal Radiotherapy in 188 Adult Patients with Stage Ι,ΙΙ and ΙΙΙA Hodgin Lymphoma</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=526</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11782269&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=21</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Pauline Brice</dc:creator><dc:creator>Marc André</dc:creator><dc:creator>Patricia Franchi-Rezgui</dc:creator><dc:creator>Irène Biasoli</dc:creator><dc:creator>C.Hennequin</dc:creator><dc:description>In patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) a continued improvement in outcome with a high cure rate is observed but with an increased treatment-induced late effects.

The possibility of vertical transmission of leukemic cells increases the attention devoted to these patients and their offspring. Three cases of pregnant young women (15–17 years of age) with AML are presented. This series of cases is the first report where gene abnormalities such as ITD mutations of the FLT3 gene and AML1/ETO fusion genes were screened in pregnant AML patients and their babies, so far. Unfortunately, very poor outcomes have been associated to similar cases described in literature, and the same was true to the patients described herein. Although very speculative, we think that the timing and possible similar exposures would be involved in all cases.</dc:description><dc:subject>acute myeloid leukemia</dc:subject><dc:subject>pregnancy</dc:subject><dc:subject>AML1/ETO</dc:subject><dc:subject>FLT3 mutation</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Blood Disorders</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:cb7cd91c965d292f1eedd4b07814b517</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:19:58Z</datestamp><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Misdiagnosis of Child Abuse Related to Delay in Diagnosing a Paediatric Brain Tumour</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=803</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1178220X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Lynne Wrennall</dc:creator><dc:description>Conflicting opinion regarding the relative weight that should be allocated to the investigation of organic causes of child illness, compared to the pursuit of suspicions of child abuse, has generated considerable public debate. The discourse of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy/Fabricated and Induced Illness is at the centre of contention. In particular, concern has arisen that children’s medical needs are being neglected when their conditions are misdiagnosed as child abuse. This paper documents a case study in which the use of Child Protection procedures was linked to the belief that the child’s illness had “no organic cause.” The case study is contextualised in a review of literature relevant to the diagnostic process. The deployment of the Child Protection perspective resulted in significant delay in the diagnosis of the child’s brain tumour. The child was ultimately found to be suffering from an optic chasm mass lesion involving the hypothalamus and the medial temporal regions, resulting in Diencephalic Syndrome. The evidence in this case is that erring on the side of suspecting Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy/Fabricated and Induced Illness, was not “erring on the side of the child.” Several lessons need to be learned from the case. The importance of ensuring that the Child Protection perspective does not displace adequate assessment of alternative explanations for the child’s condition is emphasised, as is the need for good communication in medical relationships. Strategies involving empathy, mediation, negotiation and conflict resolution may provide a more appropriate and therapeutic alternative to the use of Child Protection procedures in cases where the diagnosis is contentious. The need to re-write relevant policy, protocols and guidance is imperative.</dc:description><dc:subject>Delayed Diagnosis</dc:subject><dc:subject>Miscarriages of Justice</dc:subject><dc:subject>Intracranial Neoplasm</dc:subject><dc:subject>Medical Error</dc:subject><dc:subject>Human Rights</dc:subject><dc:subject>Service User Perspectives.</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Pediatrics</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:a5ea8ab3ab0db53bf6542b3d8c0e6b56</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:23:27Z</datestamp><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Lemierre Syndrome: Two Preschool Children with Cerebral Infarcts</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=888</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1178220X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=13</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Miriam Santschi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Michèle David</dc:creator><dc:creator>Laurent Garel</dc:creator><dc:creator>Michel Vanasse</dc:creator><dc:creator>France Gauvin</dc:creator><dc:description>We report two children who developed hemiparesis secondary to cerebral infarcts complicating Lemierre syndrome.

Body mass index (BMI) had high significant correlation with each of the indicator and with systolic blood pressure (SBP) as well, in both sexes. All the indicators with conventional cut offs showed poor sensitivity for predicting high SBP. However, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) cut-offs improved sensitivity considerably, but the values were much lower compared to conventional cut-offs.Conclusions: There is considerable disparity in the estimates of overweight children obtained by different indicators. Lower values of ROC cut-offs highlights the need for population specific customized classification systems for assessing obesity in view of the probable population differences in relative risks of non-communicable adult diseases.</dc:description><dc:subject>Indian affluent adolescents</dc:subject><dc:subject>systolic blood pressure</dc:subject><dc:subject>ROC</dc:subject><dc:subject>sensitivity and specificity</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Pediatrics</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:ce892fecb84ce6f3f3cfd809f3a2bda0</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:28:01Z</datestamp><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Beyond Television: Children’s Engagement with Online Food and Beverage Marketing</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=916</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1178220X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=Obesity&amp;spage=1</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Jennifer Brady</dc:creator><dc:creator>Amber Farrell</dc:creator><dc:creator>Sharon Wong</dc:creator><dc:creator>Rena Mendelson</dc:creator><dc:description>Background:  Food and beverage marketing has been implicated in the childhood obesity “pandemic.” Prior studies have established the negative impact of television advertising on children’s dietary intake, yet few have considered the role of online food and beverage marketing, particularly within the Canadian context.Objective: This study explores children’s engagement in online marketing and investigates the potential impact on their dietary intake.Methods: Participants were recruited from the Ryerson University Summer Day Camp to participate in a single one-on-one semi-structured interview.Results: A total of 83 children (age 7 to13 years; mean 9.99 years; 56.3% boys, 43.8% girls) participated in the study. Fewer children thought that there is food, drink, or candy advertising on the internet (67.7%) than on television (98.8%) (p 0.001). Awareness of online marketing increased with age: 7 to 8 year olds (23.67%; 4), 9 to10 years (63.89%; 23), 11 to12 years (86.96%; 20); 13 years (100%; 9). Over one-third of children had visited a website after seeing the address advertised on television (n = 32; 38.55%) or on product package (n = 29; 34.94%).Conclusions: Branded internet sites, commonly featured on television and product packaging, offer new opportunities for marketers to reach children with messages promoting commercial food and beverage items. These websites are subsequently spread via word-of-mouth through children’s peer networks. The independent impact of web-based food, drink and candy marketing, as well as the synergistic effect of multi-channel product promotion, on children’s dietary intake merits further investigation.</dc:description><dc:subject>child</dc:subject><dc:subject>food and beverages</dc:subject><dc:subject>marketing</dc:subject><dc:subject>advertising</dc:subject><dc:subject>Internet</dc:subject><dc:source>Clinical Medicine : Pediatrics</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:a6cdd9cf066a053a5bc14fe6014de5c9</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:32:22Z</datestamp><setSpec>Chemistry</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Introductory Editorial (Lipid Insights)</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=666</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786353&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Tim Levine</dc:creator><dc:source>Lipid Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:280567096644a266799921c6aca53809</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:34:07Z</datestamp><setSpec>Chemistry</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>New Functions for Oxysterols and Their Cellular Receptors</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=883</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786353&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=Current+Developments&amp;spage=1</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Vesa M.

These compounds display cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and pro-inflammatory activities and may play a role in the pathology of atherosclerosis. Their functions as intermediates in the synthesis of bile acids and steroid hormones, and as readily transportable forms of sterol are well established. During the past decade, however, novel physiologic activities of oxysterols have emerged. They are now thought to act as endogenous regulators of gene expression in lipid metabolism. Recently, new intracellular oxysterol receptors have been identified and novel functions of oxysterols in cell signaling discovered, evoking novel interest in these compounds in several branches of biomedical research.</dc:description><dc:subject>cell signaling</dc:subject><dc:subject>lipid metabolism</dc:subject><dc:subject>oxysterol</dc:subject><dc:subject>oxysterol-binding protein</dc:subject><dc:source>Lipid Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:748846005b09bd607479d131db766278</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:39:46Z</datestamp><setSpec>Chemistry</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Changes and Effects of Dietary Oxidized Lipids in the Gastrointestinal Tract</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=884</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786353&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=Current+Developments&amp;spage=11</dc:identifier><dc:creator>G.

A survey of the literature reporting changes and effects of oxidized lipids before absorption, first in the stomach and then during enzymatic lipolysis in the small intestine, are addressed. Also, the fate of non-absorbed compounds and their potential implications at the colorectal level are discussed. Among the results found, it is shown that acidic gastric conditions and the influence of other dietary components may lead to either further oxidation or antioxidative effects in the stomach. Also, changes in oxidized functions, especially of hydroperoxy and epoxy groups, seem likely to occur. Enzymatic hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase is not effective for triacylglycerol polymers, and hence they can be found as non-absorbed oxidized lipids in the large intestine. Interactions of oxidized lipids with cholesterol absorption in the small intestine and with microflora metabolism have been also observed.</dc:description><dc:subject>Dietary oxidized lipids</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gastrointestinal tract</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hydroperoxides</dc:subject><dc:subject>Polymers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Gastric conditions</dc:subject><dc:subject>Nonabsorbed lipids</dc:subject><dc:source>Lipid Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:32450705421ba0d4a4e79d9d09ca99de</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:41:33Z</datestamp><setSpec>Mathematics_and_Statistics</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Shoikhet&apos;s Conjecture and Duflo Isomorphism on (Co)Invariants</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.3842/SIGMA.2008.060</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=18150659&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=&amp;spage=060</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Damien Calaque</dc:creator><dc:creator>Carlo A.

The two best-studied members are the pathogenic species B. hyodysenteriae (the aetiological agent of swine dysentery) and B. pilosicoli (a cause of intestinal spirochaetosis in humans and other species). Analysis of near-complete genome sequences of these two species identiﬁ ed a highly conserved 26 kilobase (kb) region that was shared, against a background of otherwise very little sequence conservation between the two species. PCR ampliﬁcation was used to identify sets of contiguous genes from this region in the related Brachyspira species B. intermedia, B. innocens, B. murdochii, B. alvinipulli, and B. aalborgi, and demonstrated the presence of at least part of this region in species from throughout the genus. Comparative genomic analysis with other sequenced bacterial species revealed that none of the completely sequenced spirochaete species from different genera contained this conserved cluster of coding sequences. In contrast, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli contained high gene cluster conservation across the 26 kb region, against an expected background of little sequence conservation between these phylogenetically distinct species. The conserved region in B. hyodysenteriae contained ﬁve genes predicted to be associated with amino acid transport and metabolism, four with energy production and conversion, two with nucleotide transport and metabolism, one with ion transport and metabolism, and four with poorly characterised or uncertain function, including an ankyrin repeat unit at the 5’ end. The most likely explanation for the presence of this 26 kb region in the Brachyspira species and in two unrelated enteric bacterial species is that the region has been involved in horizontal gene transfer.</dc:description><dc:subject>Horizontal gene transfer</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brachyspira</dc:subject><dc:subject>genomic island</dc:subject><dc:source>Microbiology Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:6ddb10d77ffa5db9554dee20950fa3af</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T06:57:25Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Toxigenicity in Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci: Epidemiological and Molecular Aspects</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=885</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786361&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=13</dc:identifier><dc:creator>M.L.R.S.

Among them are staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs), which cause staphylococcal food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Some reports indicate that TSST-1 and staphylococcal enterotoxins are also produced by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). The present review aimed to discuss general aspects of staphylococcal toxins as well as the epidemiology, genetics and detection of toxins in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, since these microorganisms are becoming more and more frequent in nosocomial infections.</dc:description><dc:subject>Toxins</dc:subject><dc:subject>Staphylococcus aureus</dc:subject><dc:subject>Coagulase-negative staphylococci</dc:subject><dc:source>Microbiology Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:edf4c2dff3c085a2bd40658a3b1494bd</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T07:00:12Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Sanitation and Microbiological Quality in Production Field and Fruit-Packing Shed of Persimmon and Satsuma Mandarin in Japan</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=906</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786361&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=25</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Hidemi Izumi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Kazuo Hisa</dc:creator><dc:creator>Yukari Murakami</dc:creator><dc:description>The effects of sanitation treatments including chlorination (ca 10 ppm available chlorine) of agricultural water and ethyl alcohol (70%) spraying on packing shed equipment on microbial contamination on fruits and the environment were determined and compared with those in conventionally managed field and packing shed in persimmon and satsuma mandarin orchards. Chlorinated water reduced the microbial counts to levels below the lower limit of detection (1.4 log CFU/ml for bacteria and 2.0 log CFU/ml for fungi) in most agricultural water samples. Microbial counts of pesticide solution, which contained the agricultural water or chlorinated water for the mixture, were lower in sanitary field than in control field in both fruit orchards. The number of bacterial and mold species detected in agricultural water, chlorinated water, and pesticide solution were almost proportional to microbial counts in each sample throughout the year. The chlorination treatment of agricultural water tended to reduce the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit during production season. The ethyl alcohol spray treatment on packing shed equipment resulted in a substantial microbial reduction on plastic harvest basket and container in persimmon orchard and plastic harvest basket and container, gloves, scissors, and size sorter in satsuma mandarin orchard. The spray application on packing shed equipment reduced the counts of mesophiles and fungi on the peel of persimmon fruit by 1 log CFU/g. The number of satsuma mandarin packing shed equipment containing the species found on fruit peel was higher in control than in sanitary packing shed. No human pathogens such as verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella were detected in any of the fruit and environmental samples. These results indicate that uses of sanitizers such as chlorine for agricultural water and ethyl alcohol for packing shed equipment would be useful in a good agricultural practices program of persimmons and satsuma mandarin.</dc:description><dc:subject>persimmons</dc:subject><dc:subject>satsuma mandarin</dc:subject><dc:subject>chlorination</dc:subject><dc:subject>ethyl alcohol spray</dc:subject><dc:subject>agricultural water</dc:subject><dc:subject>packing shed equipment</dc:subject><dc:source>Microbiology Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:d44a6abfd1b73ccbcb871705e50dc94e</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T07:02:43Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Distribution and Resistance Trends of Community Associated Urinary Tract Pathogens in Sharjah, UAE</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://la-press.com/article.php?article_id=936</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=11786361&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=&amp;spage=41</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Nihar Dash</dc:creator><dc:creator>Mansour AL-Zarouni</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nora Al-Kous</dc:creator><dc:creator>Fatma Al- Shehhi</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jalila Al-Najjar</dc:creator><dc:creator>Abiola Senok</dc:creator><dc:creator>Debadatta Panigrahi</dc:creator><dc:description>Objective: To describe the spectrum of etiologic agents causing community associated UTI and their antimicrobial resistance trends in a large teaching hospital in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.Methods:  A retrospective review of the microbiology laboratory records of four hundred ninety two cases of community associated UTI between April 2006 and March 2007 was carried out. Etiologic agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern were analyzed.Results:  A wide spectrum of uropathogens was isolated of which the leading etiologic agents of community associated UTI were Escherichia coli (207 strains) and Klebsiella species (90 strains). Sixty-six per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were resistant to amoxicillin, 58.5% were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and more than 50% were resistant to cephalexin. How- ever, resistance rate to antimicrobials like ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone remain relatively low 9.7% and 7.6% respectively.Conclusions:  Escherichia coli remains the leading cause of community associated UTI. In-vitro antimicrobial resistance pattern of the isolates revealed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin and amoxycillin the commonly used first- line antimicrobials were becoming less and less effective in their treatment. This information can help in changing preferences of suitable antimicrobial agent in treatment of community associated UTI.</dc:description><dc:subject>Urinary tract infection</dc:subject><dc:subject>Etiology</dc:subject><dc:subject>Antimicrobial susceptibility</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia coli</dc:subject><dc:subject>Drug resistance</dc:subject><dc:source>Microbiology Insights</dc:source><dc:publisher>Libertas Academica</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:a519225078c580db1443c7b2ca3faa7a</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T15:26:53Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Cartilage Integration: Evaluation of the reasons for failure of integration during cartilage repair.

Where lesions do penetrate the bony subchondral plate, formation of hematomas and the migration of mesenchymal stem cells provide an inferior and transient fibrocartilagenous replacement for hyaline cartilage. To circumvent the poor intrinsic reparative response of articular cartilage several surgical techniques based on tissue transplantation have emerged. One characteristic shared by intrinsic reparative processes and the new surgical therapies is an apparent lack of lateral integration of repair or graft tissue with the host cartilage that can lead to poor prognosis. Many factors have been cited as impeding cartilage:cartilage integration including; chondrocyte cell death, chondrocyte dedifferentiation, the nature of the collagenous and proteoglycan networks that constitute the extracellular matrix, the type of biomaterial scaffold employed in repair and the origin of the cells used to repopulate the defect or lesion. This review addresses the principal intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impede integration and describe how manipulation of these factors using a host of strategies can positively influence cartilage integration. </dc:description><dc:subject>cartilage</dc:subject><dc:subject>integration</dc:subject><dc:subject>repair</dc:subject><dc:subject>autologous chondrocyte implantation</dc:subject><dc:source>European Cells and Materials (ECM)</dc:source><dc:publisher>European Cells &amp; Materials Ltd</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:364e792d7aa0167a8bf123aadc41ee3b</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T16:03:55Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Science_General</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Analysis of controversies and cognitive conflicts through a lakatosian view.

We tried to investigate whether there is a relationship between the type of hypertextual organization of information and the resulting type of learning and/or reasoning, attempting to understand which are the best solutions in terms of hypermedia documents construction. In order to support theoretically our study we used the theories of meaningful learning and cognitive flexibility. Two hyperdocuments, constructed with similar contents but different organization (hierarchically and in network) were applied to a sample of 31 students (14 5o 16 years). In the construction of the hyperdocuments studies by Chi et al. on conceptual change were also taken into account. Research findings suggest that hierarchical hypertextual structure seems to favor subordinate and superordinate meaningful learning associated to descriptive and classificative reasonings. However, the network hipertextual structure, while favoring cognitive flexibility, might stimulate progressive differentiation and integrative reconciliation promoting combinatorial learning associated to interpretive and explicative reasonings.</dc:description><dc:subject>hipertextual structure</dc:subject><dc:subject>Earth sciences</dc:subject><dc:subject>meaningful learning </dc:subject><dc:source>Investigações em Ensino de Ciências</dc:source><dc:publisher>Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul </dc:publisher><dc:date>2003</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:0f03cc5d5adead94c505bff9ed7e4ad8</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T16:09:15Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Science_General</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Conflict among school of thought in mathematics: exploring potentialities to improve the teaching of mathematics and physics</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.if.ufrgs.br/ienci/artigos/Artigo_ID97/v8_n1_a2003.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=15188795&amp;date=2003&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=53</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Bernardo Leopardi Gonçalves B.

In a perspective in that the teacher is placed as mediator of the teaching process, one of his/her roles is the administration of such paradox. This work intends to show that one way of dealing with such paradox can be the introduction of small &quot; disturbances &quot; in the stability of the contract, starting from closed problems with unexpected innovations for the student, such as: providing unnecessary data, suppressing data already known by the student or situations that request the articulation of knowledge. The disturbance of traditional problems will demand a qualitative reflection and creative investment, of teacher and student, avoiding automatisms and maintaining them open to progresses without, however, to break with the established Didactic Contract.</dc:description><dc:subject>teaching by mediation</dc:subject><dc:subject>paradox management</dc:subject><dc:subject>perturbation of didactical contract</dc:subject><dc:source>Investigações em Ensino de Ciências</dc:source><dc:publisher>Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul </dc:publisher><dc:date>2003</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:1b0a8137e69317c70444e867e8afc439</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T16:55:23Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Science_General</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Analysis of a didactical situation: comprehension of the health-disease process</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.if.ufrgs.br/ienci/artigos/Artigo_ID103/v8_n2_a2003.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=15188795&amp;date=2003&amp;volume=8&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=165</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Márcia Regina Pfuetzenreiter</dc:creator><dc:creator>José Francisco Custódio</dc:creator><dc:creator>Raica Koepsel</dc:creator><dc:description>The work describes a didactic situation that took place in the discipline of &quot; Preventive Veterinary Medicine and Public Health&quot; in a course of Veterinary Medicine, in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil.

In this paper, I contend that the Molinist thesis is deficient because it can provide no adequate account of how God could have knowledge of this kind. I argue against Saurez and Kvanvig’s proposal that divine knowledge of the possibleagent’s creaturely essence is sufficient for perfect foreknowledge of what that agent would in any specific circumstance.

Badiou’s thinking is remarkable chiefly for taking so strong and principled a stand against just about every major direction of the present-dayphilosophic tide. He has affirmed the absolute priority of ontology over epistemology, truth over knowledge, knowledge over the means or mode of its linguistic representation, and the claim of mathematics as prima philosophia over those of various currently favoured rival candidates. This involves a far-reaching conception of set theory and its ontological bearings, one that – if valid – bids fairto redefine the very terms and conditions of rational enquiry across the whole range of the natural and social or human sciences. Badiou starts out from a rigorous distinction between being and event, or ontology and that which exceeds or disrupts the existing ontological order. Such episodes occur through the advent of some wholly unprecedented claim on the allegiance of subjects – whether scientists, artists, political activists, or ethical agents – who most clearly perceive its challenge and who resolve to pursue its implications to the utmost of their intellectual,creative or investigative powers. Thus Badiou sees the constant extension andrefinement of set-theoretical concepts from Cantor to the present as an objectlesson in the way that knowledge typically accrues through successive encounters with a limit on its present-best powers of rational comprehension. This sense of falling-short, or presumptive anomaly, in turn provides the impetus that ‘forces’ thought (through a formal operation that Badiou lays out in precisely specified set theoretical terms) to move beyond its current, restricted stage of development and achieve what was hitherto a strictly inconceivable advance. As well as describing these technical aspects of his work in philosophy of mathematics, logic and the formal sciences I explain – for the benefit of those trained up in the more compartmentalized mindset of analytic philosophy – how these aspects relate to Badiou’s thinking in the fields of ethics, politics, aesthetics, and psychoanalysis. Above all I stress his singular capacity to combine the most adventurous and widerangingforays into realms of speculative thought with the highest degree ofconceptual rigour and logical precision.</dc:description><dc:subject>Badiou</dc:subject><dc:subject>Platonism</dc:subject><dc:subject>Mathematics</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ontology</dc:subject><dc:source>Philosophical Frontiers : A Journal of Emerging Thought</dc:source><dc:publisher>Progressive Frontiers Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:f1061a7cd68f9865bbac246de79fa7ae</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T18:27:11Z</datestamp><setSpec>Philosophy_and_Religion</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Berlin, Dewey and Rawls: Relativism and Liberalism</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.philosophicalfrontiers.com/bertman.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17581532&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=29</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Martin A. Bertman</dc:creator><dc:description>The thesis of this paper is that modern liberalismreflects the position of the sophist Protagoras as Plato describes it. The perspective of historicism (often coupled with the assumption of progress) is widely accepted and drives cultural relativism; further, one remedy given to stabilize the politicalorder is education to a culturally guided moral aesthetic and technology. Among the three modern ‘sophists’ discussed Berlin, like the modern social sciences, shows the skeptical influence of Hume division of fact and value and also his ‘amiable’humanism. Dewey attaches himself to technology-science to lead ‘social intelligence’to a stable foundation to constantly transform the social order by making it flourish in a ‘precarious’ world. Rawls tries to achieve stability by a middle-ranged moral concept: fairness, intimate to ‘a’ ideal theory of justice based on national cultural values. Each of these liberal doctrines approaches the primary notion of freedom within a relative perspective that needs stability, which is aside from classical (or religious) metaphysical truth that is universal and unconditional.</dc:description><dc:subject>Berlin</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dewey</dc:subject><dc:subject>Rawls</dc:subject><dc:subject>Liberalim</dc:subject><dc:subject>Relativism</dc:subject><dc:source>Philosophical Frontiers : A Journal of Emerging Thought</dc:source><dc:publisher>Progressive Frontiers Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:1be4d7d334ae3cc37c0d6cdcf121f5f2</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:02:31Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Seventh edition of “Ambiente e Água” journal</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/150/156</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=3</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Getulio Teixeira Batista</dc:creator><dc:description>The publication of the seventh edition of “Revista Ambiente e Água – An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science (Ambi-Água)” demonstrates the international visibility that the journal is reaching. An unprecedented number of submissions has been received for this issue and resulted in an increased number (50%) of published articles, as compared to the first two volumes that had six articles published. This issue brings nine peer reviewed articles out of which 5 are published in English. Among those two were submitted from abroad (Nigeria and Argentina) in addition to several paper co-authors from the United States. The participation in the authorship of public universities and municipal, state and federal institutions was also significant. There were 18 authors in this issue from those institutions not considering those authors from abroad. There was also a thematic coverage expansion of articles within the interdisciplinary scope of Ambi-Água. An example of this is an article in Engineering concerned with thermal comfort in urban areas; several submissions in environmental chemistry with two published articles (organic and inorganic chemistry); one article in the area of public health and antimicrobial resistance in aquatic ecosystem; other in sensibility to oil spilling charting in coastal islands; chemical contamination in fish due to the improper land use in Amazonia; and two articles in hydrological modeling in watersheds. Powered by the OAI-PMH protocol (Batista, 2007), which greatly enhances the visibility of the journal, in addition to the fact that Ambi-Água appears in several international indexing systems and its free on-line availability with open access policy, the journal is being frequently consulted. In only two months (June 15 to August 15, 2008) there were 4,556 consultations with an average of approximately 500 consultations a week. These consultations came from 616 cities, 79 countries, and five continents in that period.</dc:description><dc:subject>Ambi-Água </dc:subject><dc:subject>Qualis CAPES </dc:subject><dc:subject>Editorial</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:40d2c042fffd3b46b4931a6fa4ee203d</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:20:03Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Impacts of some divalent cations on periplasmic nitrate reductase and dehydrogenase enzymes of Escherichia, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/135/161</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=5</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Justina Chibuogwu Orji, Christian O.

NAP and DHA activitieswere estimated from nitrite and triphenyl formazan produced respectively after 4h incubationat 28 ± 2oC. Hg2+ completely inhibited NAP activity in Escherichia and Pseudomonas spp. atall the concentrations (0.2 – 1mM) while progressive inhibitions of NAP activity wereobserved in Escherichia and Pseudomonas spp. with increasing concentrations of Zn2+ andCd2+. Both metals were stimulatory to NAP of Acinetobacter sp. at 0.2 – 1mM. Apart fromstimulation of DHA activity by Zn2+ (0.2 – 1mM) in Escherichia sp., Cd2+ (0.4 -1.0mM) inAcinetobacter sp. and (1.0mM) in Pseudomonas sp., all the metals progressively inhibitedDHA activities in the three organisms. In Escherichia sp., the activities of the two enzymeswere negatively correlated on exposure to Zn2+ (r = -0.91) and positively correlated (r =&gt;0.90) on exposure to Cd2+ and Hg2+. Based on IC50 values of the metals for the DHA andNAP enzymes, the most resistant of the three organisms were Escherichia sp. andAcinetobacter sp. respectively. Quantitatively, NAP with its lower IC50 values than DHA wasa more sensitive toxicity measure for Hg2+ in all the organisms. The sensitivity of microbialmetabolic enzymes to the toxic effects of metals varies with the type of enzyme, metal and themicroorganism involved.</dc:description><dc:subject>Periplasmic nitrate reductase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Dehydrogenase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia sp.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pseudomonas sp.</dc:subject><dc:subject>Acinetobacter sp.</dc:subject><dc:subject>IC50</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hg2+</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cd2+ and Zn2+</dc:subject><dc:subject>Reductase do nitrato periplásmico</dc:subject><dc:subject>dehidrogenase</dc:subject><dc:subject>Escherichia sp</dc:subject><dc:subject>Pseudomonas sp</dc:subject><dc:subject>de Acinetobactéria sp</dc:subject><dc:subject>IC50</dc:subject><dc:subject>Hg2+</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cd2+ e Zn2+.</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:988d2444439e2b5220548d768bb98705</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:25:10Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Mercury Bioaccumulation in the Brazilian Amazonian Tucunares (Cichla sp., Cichlidae, Perciformes)</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/106/162</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=19</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Ysrael Marrero Vera, Roberto José Carvalho, Zuleica Carmen Castilhos, Maria Josefina Reyna Kurtz</dc:creator><dc:description>There are emissions of mercury to the atmosphere, soil and rivers of the BrazilianAmazon stem from many sources. Once in the atmosphere, the metal is oxidized andimmediately deposited. In the water, the transformation to methylmercury takes place mostlyby the action of microorganisms. The formation of methylmercury increases the dispersionand bioavailability of the element in the aquatic environment. Methylmercury can beassimilated by plankton and enters the food chain. The concentration of mercury increasesfurther up in the trophic levels of the chain and reaches the highest values in carnivorousfishes like tucunare. Therefore, mercury emissions cause the contamination of naturalresources and increase risks to the health of regular fish consumers. The objective of thiswork was to study the bioaccumulation of mercury in tucunares (Cichla sp.), top predators ofthe food chain. The fishes were collected at two locations representative of the Amazonianfluvial ecosystem, in the state of Pará, Brazil, in 1992 and 2001. One location is near a formerinformal gold mining area. The other is far from the mining area and is considered pristine.Average values of total mercury concentration and accumulation rates for four differentcollection groups were compared and discussed. Tucunares collected in 2001 presentedhigher mercury contents and accumulated mercury faster than tucunares collected in 1992notwithstanding the decline of mining activities in this period. The aggravation of themercury contamination with time not only in an area where informal gold mining waspracticed but also far from this area is confirmed.</dc:description><dc:subject>mercury</dc:subject><dc:subject>bioaccumulation</dc:subject><dc:subject>tucunares</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amazon</dc:subject><dc:subject>mercúrio</dc:subject><dc:subject>bioacumulação</dc:subject><dc:subject>tucunarés</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amazônia.</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:3eea8326e08e45f45d3a3d1d11235f7d</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:29:49Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in water from different sources in a subtropical region of Argentina</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/143/163</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=28</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Liliana Silvina Lösch, José Mario Alonso, Luis Antonio Merino</dc:creator><dc:description>In order to determine the occurrence of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 506samples of drinking water, surface water, and ground water were studied in the province ofChaco, Argentina.

From May2004 to June 2005 water dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature weremeasured to stream water chemical and physical description. DIC and pCO2 measurementswere made by headspace extraction and gas samples for pCO2 and DIC extractions were runon an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA, LI-COR Instruments model LI-820). Results indicate arelationship between soil type and water chemistry, where sandy soil stream presented lowerpH than silty soil stream – consequently DIC and pCO2 concentrations also varied with soiltype. Mean DIC concentration for sitly soil stream was 403±130 μM month-1, while sandy soilstream DIC concentration was 170±59 μM month-1. Free CO2 was the dominant form of DICin both streams. Nevertheless, HCO3- contribuition to DIC was greater for the silty soil stream.DIC contentration also varied seasonally with greater values in the drier period. AbsolutepCO2 values were greater for silty soil stream, mean 3067±1228 Iatm month-1 and2321±1020 Iatm month-1 for sandy soil stream. Seasonality, pCO2 was higher in the dryseason in both streams. Our findings have important implications on the role of soil type inwater chemistry and carbon dynamics and also are used in other studies on carbon balance atthe landscape level.</dc:description><dc:subject>Amazonia</dc:subject><dc:subject>streams</dc:subject><dc:subject>soil type</dc:subject><dc:subject>DIC</dc:subject><dc:subject>pCO2</dc:subject><dc:subject>Amazônia</dc:subject><dc:subject>igarapés</dc:subject><dc:subject>tipo de solo</dc:subject><dc:subject>CID</dc:subject><dc:subject>pCO2.</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:219ad2910d840a968190ec3ecfcbae09</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:38:05Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Evaporative cooling: water for thermal comfort</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/118/165</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=51</dc:identifier><dc:creator>José Rui Camargo</dc:creator><dc:description>Evaporative cooling is an environmentally friendly air conditioning system that operatesusing induced processes of heat and mass transfer, where water and air are the working fluids.It consists, specifically, in water evaporation, induced by the passage of an air flow, thusdecreasing the air temperature.

Initially it presents the basic operation principles ofdirect and indirect evaporative cooling and defines the effectiveness of the systems.Afterwards, it presents three methods that allows to determinate where the systems are moreefficient.

Regionalization of hydrologic information is analternative way to get this lacking information. The regionalization models, however, are asimplified representation of natural phenomena, what could lead to miscalculation. Therefore,these models should be tested before being used as a management tool. This paper evaluatesthe performance of the regionalization models created for the Santa Bárbara River Basinregion, in Goiás. This river basin is located between 17º45’ and 18º15’ South and 49º36’ and50º03’ West and has a catchment area of 1371,16 km2. The models estimate average streamflow, maximum streamflow, minimum streamflow, the 95% duration streamflow, theseven day, ten years, minimum streamflow and the monthly-average streamflows. The testedstreamflow regionalization models proved to be good enough for average flows, but not formaximum and minimum events. The models based on homogeneous regions were superior tothose that ignored that aspect. The model that uses drainage area and density to estimate the95% duration streamflow could be used in water resources management with little error. Theuse of this model would better represent the water availability at Santa Bárbara River Basinthan a few local measurements currently used.</dc:description><dc:subject>water resources</dc:subject><dc:subject>water availability</dc:subject><dc:subject>reference flows</dc:subject><dc:subject>recursos hídricos</dc:subject><dc:subject>disponibilidade hídrica</dc:subject><dc:subject>vazões de referência.</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:b2ef276ef6a894a4737f43dc6bb3625c</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:46:12Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Determination of saturated areas using TOPMODEL in the Pequeno river watershed, Southern Brazil (pt)</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/90/167</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=77</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Irani dos Santos, Masato Kobiyama </dc:creator><dc:description>This work presents the determination of saturated areas in the Pequeno River watershed(104 km2), located in the São José dos Pinhais District, Metropolitan Region of Curitiba,Paraná State, Brazil. We employed the hydrological model TOPMODEL which assumes thatthe water dynamics are influenced by soil and hillslope characteristics of the entire watershed.It calculates the runoff and the spatial distribution (saturated and unsaturated areas) of the soilhumidity in the system throughout the considered time period. The maps of the saturatedareas were analyzed taking into account the land use and riparian vegetation (permanentpreservation). The computations showed a good adherence between calculated and observedrunoff (R²=0.75), thus confirming the model efficiency in regions of humid climate andsmooth topography. The simulation results reveal a potential application for environmentalplanning because they allow the discussion and further orientation for human interventions inthe environment based on the understanding of the natural processes.</dc:description><dc:subject>TOPMODEL</dc:subject><dc:subject>saturated area</dc:subject><dc:subject>environmental planning</dc:subject><dc:subject>TOPMODEL</dc:subject><dc:subject>área saturada</dc:subject><dc:subject>planejamento ambiental.</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:7fb7d854b2a7f041c45c42b28405ed5f</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-03T19:49:25Z</datestamp><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Phytoplankton density and trophic state of Canha and Pariquera-Açu rivers, Ribeira de Iguape hydrographic basin, SP, Brazil (pt)</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.agro.unitau.br/seer/index.php/ambi-agua/article/view/114/169</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1980993X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=90</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Davi Gasparini Fernandes Cunha, Patrícia Bortoletto de Falco, Maria do Carmo Calijuri </dc:creator><dc:description>Regarding the lack of studies about lotic eutrophication, mainly for tropical rivers, thisresearch aimed to assess the density of phytoplanktonic community of two tropical riverslocated in Ribeira do Iguape Watershed (São Paulo state, Brazil), Canha and Pariquera-AçuRivers, based on sampling campaigns in January and April, 2007. These results werecompared to the mTSI (mean Trophic State Index) values. This index was originallydeveloped for lentic aquatic systems and its calculus depends on total phosphorous,orthophosphate and chlorophyll-a concentrations in water samples. Comparing mTSI valuesin all sampling stations with the phytoplankton quantitative results, it was possible to verifythat mTSI may overestimate the trophic state of lotic ecosystems, since the phosphorusspecies that integrate its calculus contributed to an improper augmentation on mTSI, whichwere incompatible with the real associated biological response. Thus, for April sampling,although mTSI values were higher, in general, phytoplankton density were lower (minimumof 83 indmL-1 for Canha River and of 66 indmL-1 for Pariquera-Açu River). In this case, thehigh total phosphorous concentrations by themselves were not enough to promoteproportional phytoplanktonic growth, which was probably limited by other factors, like watertemperature, suspended solids concentration, river discharge and zooplanktonic predation. InJanuary, on the other hand, mTSI values were lower, but total phytoplankton density washigher. For this sampling, the lower orthophosphate concentrations in water pointedphytoplankton assimilation of this nutrient.</dc:description><dc:subject>lotic eutrophication</dc:subject><dc:subject>phytoplanktonic community</dc:subject><dc:subject>tropical rivers</dc:subject><dc:subject>Ribeira do Iguape Valley (São Paulo state</dc:subject><dc:subject>Brazil)</dc:subject><dc:subject>eutrofização de rios</dc:subject><dc:subject>comunidade fitoplanctônica</dc:subject><dc:subject>rios tropicais</dc:subject><dc:subject>Baixo Ribeira de Iguape (SP).</dc:subject><dc:source>Ambiente e Agua : An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science</dc:source><dc:publisher>Instituto de Pesquisas Ambientais em Bacias Hidrográficas (IPABHi)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken cursor="700" completeListSize="842">:2008-09-01:2008-09-05:oai_dc:750</resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
