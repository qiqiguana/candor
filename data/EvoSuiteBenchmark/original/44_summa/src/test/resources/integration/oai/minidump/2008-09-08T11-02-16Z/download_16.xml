Chokr</dc:creator><dc:description>I examine the significance and promise of the ‘paradigm shift’evinced by the emergence and reception of the ‘embodied and situated cognition’ research program (ESC) in the past few decades. Such a program puts in question age-old assumptions, dichotomies and distinctions in the history of Western philosophy stretching back to Plato and onward to Descartes and beyond, up to the so- called ‘cognitivist framework’ (CF), which has come to dominate in both (Anglo-American) philosophy and the cognitive sciences. In order to better understand the main point(s) of contention between theses programs, I begin by tracing historically the emergence of CF to the Cartesian legacy – properly understood and interpreted, and proceed to characterize the fundamental contrast between CF and ESC, as I see it, in light of some of the empirical work done in recent years. I then turn to a philosophical discussion of the notions of‘embodiment’ and situatedness’ in order to delineate the proper and necessary background context for understanding ultimately what is at stake, in an effort to see how they are best ‘cashed in’ both theoretically and empirically. Finally, I re-focuson the situatedness of human cognition in order to make a modes proposal that further emphasizes its importance and significance within a properly conceived ESC research program, in which, I argue, despite claims to the contrary, the distinction between ‘embodied’ and ‘situated cognition’ does not make much sense. My proposal has, I contend, profound implications for future work at the intersectionof philosophy, the cognitive sciences, and socio-cultural studies, and possibly for reconceiving these endeavors and their relations altogether.</dc:description><dc:subject>Embodied</dc:subject><dc:subject>Situated</dc:subject><dc:subject>Cognition</dc:subject><dc:subject>Paradigm</dc:subject><dc:subject>Shift</dc:subject><dc:subject>ESC</dc:subject><dc:subject>CF</dc:subject><dc:source>Philosophical Frontiers : A Journal of Emerging Thought</dc:source><dc:publisher>Progressive Frontiers Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:92012512d4c64d299f87f48c31b2b424</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T10:55:05Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Particle size distribution and dissolution properties of metals in cyclone fly ash</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503007.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=485</dc:identifier><dc:creator>H.

This result indicates that cyclone fly ash consists of particles with a small diameter. The metals in the cyclone fly ash were enriched in small particles. The highest concentrations for zinc, copper, lead, cadmium and molybdenum in the cyclone fly ash were found in the smallest particle size fraction (&lt; 0.075 mm.) and for Barium, chromium, nickel, Vanadium and Cobalt in the second to smallest particle size fraction (0.075–0.125 mm.). From an environmental and toxicological standpoint, the smallest particles are of the greatest concern when ash is handed at landfill disposal sites (transport and disposal especially in stormy weather conditions), and some studies have reported risks to workers from prolonged exposure to ash. The results of the comparison of various dissolution methods for metals showed that the digestion procedures with nitric acid alone (USEPA 3051) or with a mixture of nitric acid + hydrogen peroxide (USEPA 3050B) slightly underestimated the metal concentrations in the cyclone fly ash. Although the use of hydrofluoric acid is often necessary for the determination of a number of elements associated with siliceous minerals, its use can result in loss of trace elements during dissolution.</dc:description><dc:subject>Bark</dc:subject><dc:subject>forest residues</dc:subject><dc:subject>grate-fired boiler</dc:subject><dc:subject>waste</dc:subject><dc:subject>wood</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:78886a60046c953073ae2967e7bb4feb</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:03:18Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Removal of Congo red from textile wastewater by ozonation</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503008.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=495</dc:identifier><dc:creator>P.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the degradation of Congo red in laboratory solution which had the chemical properties of the rinse waters of textile manufacturing dye-houses and the samples with Congo red alone wastewater by ozonation and to optimize the reaction parameters such as pH and time which influence the efficiencies of total organic carbon, total kjeldahl nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal. Ozonation of Congo red dye were carried out in a semi-batch reactor with constant ozone flow rate and concentration of 23 mL/sec and 13.6 mg/L, respectively. Decolorization was complete within a few minutes of ozonation possibly due to the cleavage of chromophore groups. It was observed that its structural destruction occurs predominantly at higher pHs. The reduction of chemical oxygen demand and destruction of the dye was more than 60 % and 42 %, respectively. Total kjeldahl nitrogen removal was accompanied by slight changes in nitrogen oxides. It can be deduced from the experimental results that: (a) the mineralization is very weak; (b) the reaction follows the indirect mechanism; i.e., the interaction of hydroxyl radicals with the dye and (c) the nitrification is rather predominant. Biological oxygen demand is declined in simulated alkalic and neutral samples respectively. At 13.6 mg O3/L, the biological oxygen demand levels were significantly enhanced. This might be attributable to the enhancement of its biodegradation at alkaline pHs.</dc:description><dc:subject>Biological factor</dc:subject><dc:subject>total organic carbon</dc:subject><dc:subject>chemical oxygen demand</dc:subject><dc:subject>azo dyes</dc:subject><dc:subject>decolorization</dc:subject><dc:subject>effluents</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:0109472e48245bcc18097e30b1a0f99f</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:11:27Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Biosorption of metal dye from aqueous solution onto Agave americana (L.) fibres</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503009.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=501</dc:identifier><dc:creator>A.

In order to optimize the biosorption process, the effect of pH, temperature, contact time and initial solution concentration was investigated in batch system. The results indicated that acidic pH=2 was favourable for metal dye removal. The increase of temperature increases the velocity of the biosorption reaction. The biosorption kinetics of alpacide yellow were closer to the pseudo-second order than to the first order model for all concentrations and temperature. The calculated thermodynamic parameters such as rG0, rH0 and rS0 indicated a spontaneous and endothermic biosorption process of metal dye onto Agave americana fibres.

A total of 250 children were sampled from six primary schools with pre-nursery facilities for a period of 18 months. Subjects were divided into two zones (A and B), monitored and examined on weekly basis. The effects of four criteria pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and carbon monoxide) on the respiratory health of the children were examined with reference to symptoms and diseases such as cough, cold, bronchitis, sinusitis and phlegm. Data were obtained from surveys of socioeconomic status of parents of subjects, three air monitoring stations and on-the-spot measurements of these pollutants and their association with symptoms and diseases analyzed. Results showed that there was a strong association between air pollution and symptoms and diseases among children. The effect was strongest among children below 2 years of age (adjusted OR = 3.5, 95%, CI 1.7-8.3) in the highly polluted zone than in the less polluted area. The higher the age of children, the lesser the susceptibility to these pollutants. These general results constitute a starting point for further research on long-term exposure to industrial air pollution and call for an urgent enforcement of regulatory standards to protect the most vulnerable groups in most of the growing metropolises of the country.</dc:description><dc:subject>Emissions</dc:subject><dc:subject>diseases</dc:subject><dc:subject>distance</dc:subject><dc:subject>pollution gradient</dc:subject><dc:subject>symptoms</dc:subject><dc:subject>vulnerability</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:d7eb885cf5e703d228142c758d57e9ea</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:18:44Z</datestamp><setSpec>Business_and_Economics</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Evaluating six soft approaches</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.economistascoruna.org/eawp/eawp.asp?qsa=ES&amp;qsb=1&amp;qsc=213&amp;qsd=223</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=15791475&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=09&amp;spage=</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Lene Sørensen </dc:creator><dc:creator>René Victor Valqui Vidal </dc:creator><dc:description>The paper introduces and evaluates six soft approaches used in strategy development and planning.

This means that we see strategy development and planning as learning processes based on Ackoff’s interactive planning principles to be supported by soft approaches in carrying out the principles in action. These six soft approaches are suitable for supporting various steps of the strategy development and planning process. These are the SWOT analysis, the Future Workshop, the Scenario methodology, Strategic Option Development and Analysis, Strategic Choice Approach and Soft Systems Methodology. Evaluations of each methodology are carried out using a conceptual framework in which the organisation, the result, the process and the technology of the specific approach are taken into consideration. Using such a conceptual framework for evaluations of soft approaches increases the understanding of them, their transparency, and their usability in practice.</dc:description><dc:source>Economic Analysis Working Papers</dc:source><dc:publisher>Economists Association of La Coruña</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:96d1cf3ebd6e98039c13b7332f285651</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:27:14Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>A combined mathematical geophysical model for prediction of pyrite oxidation and pollutant leaching associated with a coal washing waste dump</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503011.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=517</dc:identifier><dc:creator>F.

In this study, the pollution problems associated with the waste produced by Alborz Sharghi Coal Washing Plant was investigated by mathematical modeling. The study area is located at 11 km. to Razmjah coal region and 45 km. to Tehran-Mashhad road in the north part od Iran. To achieve the goal, a few samples were taken from different depths at three points on the waste dump in order to investigate pyrite oxidation and pollution generation. The samples were then analysed, using an AA–670 Shimadzu atomic absorption to determine the fraction of pyrite remained within the waste particles. A numerical finite volume model using Phoenics package has been developed to simulate pyrite oxidation and pollution generation from the Alborz Sharghi coal washing waste dump. The pyrite oxidation reaction is described by the shrinking-core model. Gaseous diffusion is the main mechanism for the transport of oxygen through the waste. The results of numerical modelling were compared with the field observations and close agreement was achieved. A simple mathematical model incorporating advection and hydrodynamic dispersion processes was also presented in order to verify the results of geophysical time-laps method showing transportation of the pollutants through the downstream of the waste dump.

Investigation of dissolved oxygen concentration on ammonium and nitrite oxidation was carried out in a batch reactor. The dissolved oxygen concentration of 0.5 mg O2/L inhibited both ammonium as well as nitrite oxidation, while increase of dissolved oxygen concentration to ~1 mg O2/L increased the ammonium oxidation rate and was comparable to that at higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Experiments were carried out in a sequencing batch reactor for more than 100 days to investigate the influence of aeration time on nitrite accumulation. The dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at ~1.0 mg O2/L (in the range of 0.8-1.5 mg/L) during the aeration stage, and volatile suspended solid was maintained at 2.0 g/L while temperature and pH were 30±1ºC and 8.3±0.1, respectively. In a typical cycle, complete nitrification occurred at aeration time longer than 6 h. When the aeration time was reduced to 4 h., ~80 % of partial nitritation was achieved. With a further reduction in aeration time to 3 h., nearly 1:1 nitrite/ammonium ratio was yielded. This result revealed that for the reactor design, aeration time determined by feasibility experiments must be considered based on the nitrogen strength in wastewater and biomass concentration in the reactor with dissolved oxygen concentration of ~1.0 mg O2/L for satisfactory partial nitrification with subsequent processes such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation.</dc:description><dc:subject>Sequencing batch reactor</dc:subject><dc:subject>ammonium oxidation</dc:subject><dc:subject>nitrite oxidation</dc:subject><dc:subject>volatile suspended solid</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:16432e43a615cd9684cc68e9d9046ad5</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:51:52Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Achieving to some outranking relationships between post mining land uses through mined land suitability analysis</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503013.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=535</dc:identifier><dc:creator>H.

There are so many factors in this problem which seriously influence on the decision judgments. Therefore, in this study a fifty-attribute framework for mined land suitability analysis including fifty numbers of economical, social, technical and mine site factors developed to be a foundation for this decision making problem. Analysis by an outranking multi-attribute decision-making technique, called elimination et choix traduisant la realite method, was taken into consideration because of its clear advantages on the field of mined land suitability analysis as compared with multi-attribute decision-making ranking techniques. Analytical hierarchy process method applied to calculate global weights of the attributes through pair wise comparison matrixes. The weights then passed to the elimination et choix traduisant la realit method so that the most efficient post mining land uses could be appointed through comparisons of pair-wise dominance relationships between alternatives. This approach applied to an illustrative example where, final results showed that, there were two non-dominated land-uses for the considered example; industrial and pasture. However by increasing indifference threshold limit, the non-dominated set reduced to a single alternative that was pasture land-use.</dc:description><dc:subject>Disturbed land</dc:subject><dc:subject>multi-attribute decision-making</dc:subject><dc:subject>analytical hierarchy process</dc:subject><dc:subject>elimination et choix traduisant la realit</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:83241e3907c719ee4fa1146a37c3cc11</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:51:58Z</datestamp><setSpec>Philosophy_and_Religion</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>A Critical Appraisal of Amini&apos;s &apos;Consciousness and the Aslleged Failure of Analytical Philosophy&apos;</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.philosophicalfrontiers.com/bond.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17581532&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=3&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=173</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Steven Bond</dc:creator><dc:subject>Majid Amini</dc:subject><dc:subject>Consciousness</dc:subject><dc:subject>Alleged</dc:subject><dc:subject>Failure</dc:subject><dc:subject>Analytical</dc:subject><dc:subject>Philosophy</dc:subject><dc:source>Philosophical Frontiers : A Journal of Emerging Thought</dc:source><dc:publisher>Progressive Frontiers Press</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:ba75b08fa272ec684c8b514a8220e166</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T11:54:31Z</datestamp><setSpec>Philosophy_and_Religion</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Book Review of Fotion, Nicholas (2007).

Consequently, its detection in the environment and investigation of the distribution between the aqueous and soil phases would be of highly importance. In this study, the detection of tetramethylthiuram disulfide in CHCl3 was successfully achieved through absorbance measurements at 280 nm, which resulted in linear calibration curves. This detection method was extended for the determination of the partition coefficient (KD) of tetramethylthiuram disulfide between CHCl3 and H2O phases at ambient temperature. The partition coefficient was subsequently used to determine the apparent partition coefficient (KD) of tetramethylthiuram disulfide between sieved soil of diamater &lt; 2.0 mm used for agricultural practices and water where by the quantification of tetramethylthiuram disulfide in water after adsorption equilibrium with soil was achieved through a solvent extraction step of tetramethylthiuram disulfide-contaminated water into CHCl3. The KD determined for an initial tetramethylthiuram disulfide concentration ranging from 3.00 ppm to 10.00 ppm showed a decreasing trend, which leveled off at high concentrations, indicating the strong irreversible adsorption behavior of tetramethylthiuram disulfide on soil at low concentrations. The proposed detection method would have the potential to determine the extent of adsorption of tetramethylthiuram disulfide in soil or its levels in water when tetramethylthiuram disulfide is introduced to soil systems for agricultural practices.</dc:description><dc:subject>Pesticides</dc:subject><dc:subject>adsorption</dc:subject><dc:subject>partition coefficient</dc:subject><dc:subject>analytical methods</dc:subject><dc:subject>environmental monitoring</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:d04c199bbadc28a466fcb6612397311a</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T12:05:12Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Economic evaluation for air pollution control technologies selection in power plants processes</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503015.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=555</dc:identifier><dc:creator>S.

This transformation, along with public pressure and increased foreign trade, is providing industries with incentives to consider their effect on the environment and to take action where required. To assist industries in determining what air pollution control technologies are best suited to power plants; an assessment of air pollution control technologies used in other countries was carried out. This assessment concluded that the best available technologies for power plants to control air emissions are electrostatic precipitators, low-NOX burners, selective catalytic reduction systems and wet flue gas desulphurization (limestone) systems. An assessment of the financial effects associated with air pollution control at power plants was conducted by completing a cost analysis. This analysis demonstrated that by increasing capital expenditure on control technologies by US$ 0.25 billion, the external costs associated with producing electricity can be reduced by almost US$ 0.5 billion. Formulation of external cost factors and the development of a software database for the information obtained from the different countries, will promote future technology selections.</dc:description><dc:subject>Environmental engineering group</dc:subject><dc:subject>environmental costing model</dc:subject><dc:subject>equipment costs</dc:subject><dc:subject>life cycle assessment</dc:subject><dc:subject>external cost</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:80aa2aa7de1a7b6992a6fb6b7cbea600</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T12:10:01Z</datestamp><setSpec>Technology_and_Engineering</setSpec><setSpec>Earth_and_Environmental_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Removal of hydrogen sulfide by zinc oxide nanoparticles in drilling fluid</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.ceers.org/ijest/issues/full/v5/n4/503016.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=17351472&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=5&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=565</dc:identifier><dc:creator>M.

It can diffuse into drilling fluid from formations during drilling of gas and oil wells. Hydrogen sulfide should be removed from this fluid to reduce the environmental pollution, protect the health of drilling workers and prevent corrosion of pipelines and equipments. In this research nano zinc oxide with 14-25 nm particle size and 44-56 m2/g specific surface area was synthesized by spray pyrolysis method. The synthesized nanoparticles were used to remove hydrogen sulfide from water based drilling fluid. The efficiency of these nanoparticles in the removal of hydrogen sulfide from drilling mud were evaluated and compared with that of bulk zinc oxide. The obtained results show that synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles are completely able to remove hydrogen sulfide from water based drilling mud in just 15 min., whereas bulk zinc oxide is able to remove 2.5% of hydrogen sulfide in as long as 90 min. under the same operating conditions.</dc:description><dc:subject>Nano zinc oxide</dc:subject><dc:subject>pollution</dc:subject><dc:subject>hydrogen suifide</dc:subject><dc:subject>scavenger</dc:subject><dc:subject>absorbent</dc:subject><dc:subject>acid gas</dc:subject><dc:source>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</dc:source><dc:publisher>Center for Environment and Energy Research and Studies (CEERS)</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:6fdab77e215eea6aa0b4e27b3e37543f</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T12:39:10Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>A REVIEW OF STATURE, BODY MASS AND MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE PROFILES OF U17, U20 AND FIRST DIVISION PLAYERS IN BRAZILIAN SOCCER</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/1/v7n3-1text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=309</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Cristiano Diniz Da Silva</dc:creator><dc:creator>Jonathan Bloomfield</dc:creator><dc:creator>João Carlos Bouzas Marins</dc:creator><dc:description>Investigations in the physiological demands of soccer have identified that a significant percentage of energy production in match performance is provided through the aerobic pathways. It is therefore important to assess maximal oxygen uptake (VO2Max) of players in order to evaluate their aerobic fitness status and optimize their physical conditioning. However, it is also important to consider the variation of (VO2Max) profiles for soccer players, with differences having been identified in terms of playing position as well as playing style. This paper reviews the academic literature between 1996 and 2006 and reports on the methodologies employed and the values obtained for stature, body mass and (VO2Max) profiles of soccer players of different positions in professional Brazilian clubs at U-17, U-20 and First Division levels. Indirect measurements accounted for the majority of tests conducted at U-17 (70%) and U-20 (84.6%) levels whereas at First Division level almost half of the (VO2Max) evaluations were performed by direct measurements (47.8%). The mean (VO2Max) profiles obtained for outfield players in U-17 was 56.95 ± 3.60 ml·kg-1·min-1, 58.13 ± 3.21 ml·kg-1·min-1 for U-20 players and 56.58 ± 5.03 ml·kg-1·min-1 for First Division players. In Brazil, the U-20 players appear to have highest VO2Max values, however the profiles reported for all outfield positions in U-17 and First Division levels are often lower than those reported for the same category of players from other countries. This may be a reflection of the style of play used in Brazilian soccer. This is further emphasized by the fact that the playing position with the highest VO2Max values was the external defenders whereas most findings from studies performed in European soccer indicate that midfielders require the highest VO2Max values.</dc:description><dc:subject>Soccer</dc:subject><dc:subject>maximal oxygen uptake</dc:subject><dc:subject>playing positions</dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:077691063cbe10aefb4b64ff0c00c9c1</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T12:39:34Z</datestamp><setSpec>Philosophy_and_Religion</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Book Review of Fotion, Nicholas, Kashnikov, Boris, and Lekea, Joanne, K.

The aim of this study was to determine the suitability and effectiveness of &quot;The 11&quot; for younger football players. Twenty-four [12 experimental (EXP), 12 control (CON)] young football players (age 10.4 ± 1.4 yr) participated. The EXP group followed &quot;The 11&quot; training programme 5 days per week, for 6 weeks, completing all but one of the 10 exercises. Prior to, and after the intervention, both EXP and CON groups performed a battery of football-specific physical tests. Changes in performance scores within each group were compared using independent t-tests (p ? 0.05). Feedback was also gathered on the young players&apos; perceptions of &quot;The 11&quot;. No injuries occurred during the study in either group. Compliance to the intervention was 72%. Measures of leg power (3 step jump and counter-movement jump) increased significantly (3.4 and 6.0% respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Speed over 20 m improved by 2% (p &lt; 0.05).

Energy expenditure values were estimated, utilizing specific equations, from the time players spent in each motor activity. The referees observed in this study had a mean age of 38.9 ± 3.8 years, body mass of 86.1 ± 7.1 kg, stature of 1.80 ± 0.07 m and a body mass index of 26.5 ± 0.6 kg·m-2. During match-play, referees covered an average distance of 9155.4 ± 70.3 meters (8411 - 9765), with a mean energy expenditure of 734.7 ± 65 kcal. This energy expenditure was significantly reduced in the second half: 359.9 ± 6.3 vs 374.7 ± 6.6 kcal (p = 0.006), and averaged to be moderate energy intensity (5 METs) with predominant utilization of the aerobic energy system. In total, during 67% of match-play the intensity was equal or lower than 3.8 METs and in 33% it was higher than 9.8 METs. The pattern of movement observed in the present study confirms that soccer refereeing may be considered as a highly intermittent exercise mode. The high to low-intensity activity ratio may be defined as 1:7.1. In conclusion, referees officiating in professional soccer matches in Brazil should perform a physical conditioning regime that provides the stamina required at this level and consume appropriate and adequate nutrition to meet the energetic demands for match-play</dc:description><dc:subject>Motion-analysis</dc:subject><dc:subject>referee</dc:subject><dc:subject>football</dc:subject><dc:subject>METs</dc:subject><dc:subject>oxygen consumption</dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:bb391ce9ec52c18777a8edc5855e4fb9</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T12:49:08Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>VENTILATION BEHAVIOR IN TRAINED AND UNTRAINED MEN DURING INCREMENTAL TEST: EVIDENCE OF ONE METABOLIC TRANSITION POINT</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/4/v7n3-4text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=335</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Flávio O.

Kiss</dc:creator><dc:description>This study aimed to describe and compare the ventilation behavior during an incremental test utilizing three mathematical models and to compare the feature of ventilation curve fitted by the best mathematical model between aerobically trained (TR) and untrained (UT) men. Thirty five subjects underwent a treadmill test with 1 km·h-1 increases every minute until exhaustion. Ventilation averages of 20 seconds were plotted against time and fitted by: bi-segmental regression model (2SRM); three-segmental regression model (3SRM); and growth exponential model (GEM). Residual sum of squares (RSS) and mean square error (MSE) were calculated for each model. The correlations between peak VO2 (VO2PEAK), peak speed (SpeedPEAK), ventilatory threshold identified by the best model (VT2SRM) and the first derivative calculated for workloads below (moderate intensity) and above (heavy intensity) VT2SRM were calculated. The RSS and MSE for GEM were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than for 2SRM and 3SRM in pooled data and in UT, but no significant difference was observed among the mathematical models in TR. In the pooled data, the first derivative of moderate intensities showed significant negative correlations with VT2SRM (r = -0.58; p &lt; 0.01) and SpeedPEAK (r = -0.46; p &lt; 0.05) while the first derivative of heavy intensities showed significant negative correlation with VT2SRM (r = -0. 43; p &lt; 0.05). In UT group the first derivative of moderate intensities showed significant negative correlations with VT2SRM (r = -0.65; p &lt; 0.05) and SpeedPEAK (r = -0.61; p &lt; 0.05), while the first derivative of heavy intensities showed significant negative correlation with VT2SRM (r= -0.73; p&lt; 0.01), SpeedPEAK (r = -0.73; p &lt; 0.01) and VO2PEAK (r = -0.61; p &lt; 0.05) in TR group. The ventilation behavior during incremental treadmill test tends to show only one threshold.

There was a slight decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) in blood and in RBCs in post-COMP. During RECOV, the GSH level in blood was reduced, the GSH level in RBCs was significantly elevated (a statistically significant difference as compared to the pre-COMP level). The post-COMP GSSG·GSH-1 in full blood did not increase significantly, but its increase was statistically significant during the 18-hour recovery period. During the post-COMP and RECOV, the GSSG·GSH-1 in RBCs slightly decreased in comparison with the pre-COMP. Vitamin C concentration in serum increased in post-COMP (49% vs. pre- COMP) and decreased to the baseline level during RECOV. In conclusion, our data show that acute exercise slightly increases the GSSG·GSH-1 in whole blood, while GSSG·GSH-1 in RBCs significantly decreases.

Each participant performed three tests in two different situations: with taping and without taping. The tests were a counter movement jump, static balance, and a dynamic posturography test. The tests and conditions were randomly performed. The path of the center of pressures was measured in the balance tests, and the vertical ground reaction forces were recorded during the push-off and landing phases of the counter movement jump. Ankle taping had no influence on balance performance or in the push off phase of the jump. However, the second peak vertical force value during the landing phase of the jump was 12% greater with ankle taping (0.66 BW, 95% CI -0.64 to 1.96). The use of prophylactic ankle taping had no influence on the balance or jump performance of healthy young subjects.

Nine obese males (26.1 ± 1.5 yrs) volunteered between study designed. The cardiac ANS activities evaluated by means of heart rate variability of power spectral analysis and cardiac QT interval were continuously measured during 5-min rest and 30-min exercise at 50% of maximal ventilation threshold (50%VTmax) on stationary ergometer with placebo (CON) or capsaicin (CAP) oral administration chosen at random. The uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and UCP 3 genetic variants of the subjects were analyzed by noninvasive genotyping method from collecting buccal mucosa cells. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in cardiac ANS activities during rest and exercise between CON and CAP trials. Although no significant difference, A/A allele of UCP2 polymorphism showed a reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) index activity compared to G/G + G/A allele during exercise intervention in our subjects. On the other hand, the data on cardiac QT interval showed no significant difference, indicating that oral administration of capsaicin did not cause any adverse effect on cardiac depolarization-repolarization. In conclusion, our results suggest that capsaicin supplementation 1 h before exercise intervention has no effect on cardiac ANS activities and cardiac electrical stability during exercise in obese individuals.

Outcome and self-confidence scores were used as dependent variables. The 48 participants were randomly assigned into four groups. Group A received correction cues and positive feedback. Group B received cues on errors of execution. Group C received positive feedback, correction cues and error cues. Group D was the control group. A pre, post and a retention test was conducted. A three way analysis of variance ANOVA (4 groups X 2 task difficulty X 3 measures) with repeated measures on the last factor revealed significant interactions for each depended variable. All the corrective feedback methods groups, increased their outcome scores over time for the easy skill, but only groups A and C for the difficult skill. Groups A and B had significantly better outcome scores than group C and the control group for the easy skill on the retention test. However, for the difficult skill, group C was better than groups A, B and D. The self confidence scores of groups A and C improved over time for the easy skill but not for group B and D. Again, for the difficult skill, only group C improved over time. Finally a regression analysis depicted that the improvement in performance predicted a proportion of the improvement in self confidence for both the easy and the difficult skill. It was concluded that when young athletes are taught skills of different difficulty, different type of instruction, might be more appropriate in order to improve outcome and self confidence.

A secondary aim was to determine if there is a gradual increase in functional performance across time. Twenty-one college-aged subjects volunteered to participate in this study and were required to perform four measures of functional performance including: counter movement vertical jump, T-test, 36.58-meter dash (40-yard), and active range of motion of the ankle. Participants were treated with a 20 minute, 10 degree Celsius cold whirlpool following the pre-test of a given functional performance measure. Participants demonstrated significant decreases in counter movement vertical jump, T-test, and 40-yard dash performance immediately following treatment. Vertical jump performance remained impaired for at least 32 minutes. While both the T-test and 40-yard dash were affected for 7 and 22 minutes post- treatment, respectively. Participants also demonstrated significant decreases in peak power and average power immediately after and for 32 minutes post-treatment. Dorsiflexion was significantly decreased 7 and 12 minutes following treatment. There were no differences for plantar flexion, inversion, or eversion. These data suggest functional performance was affected immediately following and for up to 32 minutes after cold whirlpool treatment. It was also evident that there is a gradual performance increase for each measure of functional performance across time.

Changes in stroke volume from 20 to 50 min of exercise were greater in 2-legged than in 1-legged (∆SV: -20.8 ± 0.8 vs. -13.3 ± 1.3 ml·beat-1, p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, changes in heart rate (∆HR) were +18.5 ± 0.8 and +10.7 ± 1.0 beats·min-1, in 2-legged and 1-legged, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Calculated blood volume changes declined significantly in 2-legged exercise (∆BV: -4.25 ± 0.43%, p &lt; 0.05). Sympathetic activation as indicated by the ratio of low and high frequency in spectral analysis of HR (LF HF-1 ratio) was higher in 2-legged than in 1- legged trial (p &lt; 0.05). At the end of exercise, CO had a tendency to decrease from 20th min in 2-legged (changes in CO = -0.92 ± 0.3 L·min-1, p = 0.07), whereas it was maintained in 1- legged cycling (∆CO = -0.15 ± 0.2 L·min-1, p = 0.86). Multiple regression analysis showed that HR rise and blood volume decline were predictors of SV drop whereas heart rate increase was explained by rectal temperature and magnitude of muscle mass activation, as indicated by iEMG (p &lt; 0.05) in 2-legged cycling. In conclusion, apart from the well-known factors of thermal status and blood volume decline, it seems that muscle mass involved plays also a role on the development of CVdrift</dc:description><dc:subject>Prolonged cycling</dc:subject><dc:subject>cardiovascular regulation</dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:4cbd56f2cdaa81df1a3b9968f144fe40</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T13:16:57Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>ATHLETE&apos;S RETENTION OF A COACH&apos;S INSTRUCTION BEFORE A JUDO COMPETITION</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/13/v7n3-13text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=402</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Isabel Mesquita</dc:creator><dc:creator>Antonio Rosado</dc:creator><dc:creator>Nuno Januário</dc:creator><dc:creator>Elsa Barroja</dc:creator><dc:description>The aim of the present study was to analyze the instruction of the Judo coach immediately before the competition, in the process of preparation for the fights, looking to (1) study the coherency between the information which the coach transmits and that which the athlete retains; (2) identify the correlation between the coherency, the extension and the number of ideas conveyed by the coach; (3) determine if the retention varies in relation to variables such as the form and nature of the information, as well as the gender and practice category of the athletes. The participants were 11 coaches and 58 athletes of 3 categories: under- 15, under-17 and under-20, of both genders. One hundred and sixteen (116) instructional episodes were observed, which corresponds to four hundred and six (406) information units convoyed by the coaches. The coaches&apos; instructions given before the competition were recorded in an audio and video register. After the coaches&apos; instruction, the athletes were approached by the investigator and an interview was accomplished. To determine if the retention varies in relation to form and nature of the information and gender and practice category of the athletes, the non-parametric statistics, U de Mann-Whitney and Kruskal- Wallis, was used. Correlation of Spearman was applied to verify the degree of association between the coherency, the extension and the number of ideas conveyed by the coach. The results showed that a substantial part of the information was not retained by the athletes and the information coherency was inversely related to the number of transmitted ideas. The coaches were, mainly, prescriptive and the form of the information was not important for the retention of the information. Gender was a differentiated variable as the girls showed more coherency in the retained ideas in relation to the ideas transmitted by the coach</dc:description><dc:subject>Athletes&apos; retention</dc:subject><dc:subject>coach&apos;s instruction</dc:subject><dc:subject>judo</dc:subject><dc:subject>competition</dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:67723b780a682354434bcfc2f5e5247a</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T13:20:49Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>LOW HANDICAP GOLFERS GENERATE MORE TORQUE AT THE SHOE-NATURAL GRASS INTERFACE WHEN USING A DRIVER</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/14/v7n3-14text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=408</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Paul Worsfold</dc:creator><dc:creator>Neal A.

Dyson</dc:creator><dc:description>The aim was to determine the rotational torque occurring at the shoe-natural grass interface during golf swing performance with different clubs, and to determine the influence of handicap and golf shoe design. Twenty-four golfers (8 low 0-7; 8 medium 8-14; and 8 high 15+) performed 5 shots with a driver, 3-iron and 7-iron when 3 shoes were worn: a modern 8 mm metal 7-spike shoe, an alternative 7-spike shoe and a flat soled shoe. Torque was measured at the front and back foot by grass covered force platforms in an outdoor field. Torque at the shoe- natural turf interface was similar at the front foot when using a driver, 3-iron and 7-iron with maximum mean torque (Tzmax 17-19 Nm) and torque generation in the entire backswing and downswing approximately 40 Nm. At the back foot, torque was less than at the front foot when using the driver, 3-iron and 7-iron. At the back foot Tzmax was 6-7 Nm, and torque generation was 10-16 Nm, with a trend for greater torque generation when using the driver rather than the irons. The metal spike shoe allowed significantly more back foot torque generation when using a driver than a flat- soled shoe (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the metal and alternative spike shoes for any torque measure (p &gt; 0.05), although back foot mean torques generated tended to be greater for the metal spike shoe. The golf shot outcomes were similar for low, medium and high handicappers in both metal and alternative spike shoes (metal: 87%; 76%; 54%; alternative: 85%; 74%; 54% respectively). The better, low handicap golfers generated significantly more back foot torque (metal spike: 18.2 Nm; alternative: 15.8 Nm; p &lt; 0.05) when using a driver. Further research should consider back foot shoe-grass interface demands during driver usage by low handicap and lighter body-weight golfers</dc:description><dc:subject>Cleat</dc:subject><dc:subject>golf</dc:subject><dc:subject>iron</dc:subject><dc:subject>shoe</dc:subject><dc:subject>spike</dc:subject><dc:subject>traction</dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:f924acbeecd129109314bdadff5a2c23</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T13:22:37Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>RECOVERY OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY AND FERTILITY IN A FORMER AMENORRHEIC ATHLETE</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/15/v7n3-15text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=415</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Karen Hind</dc:creator><dc:description>Inadequate dietary intake and prolonged amenorrhea in women athletes can lead to bone loss, particularly at the spine, which may be irreversible. This report presents the case of a woman endurance runner, followed prospectively over 6 years after presenting with the female athlete triad. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. At baseline, lumbar spine (LS), total hip and total body (TB) BMD Z-scores were -2.2, -0.5 and -0.3 respectively. At 6 years, following a recovery plan of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), weight gain, improved dietary intake and reduced training load, the athlete regained menstrual function and BMD. LS, TB and hip BMD Z-scores improved to -0.6, -0.1 and 0.1 respectively. Restoration of fertility was indicated by pregnancy, following only 4 months of regular menstruation. This case report suggests that bone density and fertility may not be completely jeopardised in formerly amenorrheic and osteopenic athletes, providing recovery through diet, weight gain, and return of menstruation is achieved within the third decade.

During the last decades not only the competitive schedule has become tougher, but after introduction of the new judging system in 2003, also more emphasis is put on difficult technical elements, jumps, steps and spins (ISU Rules, 2006). More studies about possible increasing prevalence of stress fractures in figure skaters and contributing factors are lacking (Dubravcic-Simunjak et al., 2003; Moran, 2000; Pecina et al., 1990). Therefore the aim of this study was to obtain data about the current stress fracture cumulative risk among elite junior and senior figure skaters, as well as possible factors that may contribute to stress fracture incidence. An anonymous questionnaire, divided into 5 sections, inquired about the prevalence of stress fracture were mailed and distributed to all 62 International Skating Union (ISU) members by the ISU headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The guidelines of the Helsinki declaration 2004 were followed. From the 644 skaters who received the questionnaire, 412 completed ones were returned from 110 female juniors (78 single skaters, 12 pair skaters and 20 ice dancers) and 135 female seniors (97 single skaters, 16 pair skaters and 22 ice dancers) and from 79 male juniors (47 single skaters, 12 pair skaters and 20 ice dancers) and 88 male seniors (50 single skaters, 16 pair skaters and 22 ice dancers), coming from different ISU members. The response rate was 62% in females and 67% in males. The median age for female skaters was 16 years and for males 18 years (range 12-25 years). All participants started to skate between 3 and 6 years of age and started to compete in national and international competitions when they were between 5 and 7 years old. At the time of this analysis, they had been skating between 9 and 20 years.In females 41 (16.7%), and in males 25 (13.8%) figure skaters reported a stress fracture, which had occurred in the last years of their skating career. The site and the number of stress fractures in female and male junior and senior figure skaters throughout their skating disciplines are shown in Table 1. From all stress fractures reported, 21 (51%) occurred in females and 12 (48%) in male figure skaters during the competitive season, while 20 (49%) stress fractures in females and 13 (52%) in male figure skaters occurred during summer training. Of the investigated skaters 93% trained almost all year round with a 1-2 month break, after the end of a skating season. There were no differences in training duration between the groups of skaters that did and did not report a stress fracture, but all skaters with stress fractures reported changes to their training routine before the occurrence of stress fractures. The overall prevalence of stress fractures in the present study was 16.7% in female and 13.8% in male figure skaters with different prevalence among the figure skating disciplines that can be explained by their different training patterns. Single skaters spend most of their training time practicing different difficult jumps and their legs suffer great impact during the whole training session. In pair skaters the female counterpart has higher stress fracture prevalence than the male, which is comparable to ice dancers. This is probably because pair skaters not only do synchronous jumps but also use throw jumps where the female skater is thrown, while the men stays on the ice. Consequently the lower extremity of the female suffers repeated high impact during landing. Pair skaters and ice dancers practice on different kind of team elements, unison and synchrony. Their lower extremities are less exposed to excessive repetitive impacts compared to single figure skaters (Dubravcic-Simunjak et al., 2003; Moran, 2000), as confirmed by James et al, 2006. Concerning possible contributing factors to stress fractures, all female and male figure skaters reported major changes in their training routine shortly before the occurrence of the stress fracture. In most cases an excessive number of repetitions of jumps and throw jumps, during each training session (up to 30 repetition of each jump), was reported. Galilee-Belfer and Guskiewicz, 2000 also reported that muscular fatigue and sudden changes in training intensity or duration may contribute to stress fracture incidence. In our survey we found that junior skaters, who participate both in junior and senior events, are exposed to greater stress and impacts than juniors who only skate either in junior or senior competitions. Of all senior skaters with stress fractures 5.9% females and 10% males attributed the occurrence to the greater number of competitions and shows, while 20.8% of all female juniors and 33.3% of all male skaters felt that the large number of competitions and shows during one skating season contributed to the occurrence of stress fractures. This is a novel and relevant finding which may have to be taken into account for developing the competition schedule. In conclusion the data suggest that the cumulative risk of stress fractures is high in figure skating, especially among single figure skaters and female pair skaters. In the light of increasing physiological demands from rigorous training and competitive schedules throughout the skating season, prevention deserves more emphasis. Proper education to athletes and coaches about training regimes, together with early recognition of stress fracture symptoms may help to decrease the stress fracture risks. Because of the large number of competitions and shows in a short period of time, it is recommended to critically review the competitive schedule. In addition, rule changes concerning the ages and skaters possibilities to compete in both senior and junior events may have to be considered</dc:description><dc:subject>STRESS FRACTURE</dc:subject><dc:subject>PREVALENCE IN ELITE</dc:subject><dc:subject>FIGURE SKATERS </dc:subject><dc:source>Journal of Sports Science and Medicine</dc:source><dc:publisher>University of Uludag</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:257cb8820be680d3b3c33b126a661bf8</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T13:27:33Z</datestamp><setSpec>Social_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>SPORT AND EXERCISE PSYCHOLOGY</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.jssm.org/vol7/n3/17/v7n3-17text.php</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=13032968&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=421</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Andy Lane</dc:creator><dc:description>DESCRIPTION The book introduces the undergraduate psychology student to both academic and professional aspects of Sport and Exercise Psychology.

Una vacuna viva oral contra esta enfermedad puede ser la solución. En el presente trabajo se seleccionó y aplicó un biomodelo para la evaluación de cepas atenuadas genéticamente de Vibrio cholerae como candidatas vacunales contra el cólera. La virulencia, capacidad de colonización y adherencia a la mucosa intestinal de las cepas fueron evaluadas mediante el uso de ratones neonatos de 2 a 4 días de nacidos de la línea Balb/c, con un peso entre 1,5-2 g. Los resultados obtenidos con este biomodelo demostraron que las cepas atenuadas genéticamente son no virulentas, colonizan y se adhieren a la mucosa intestinal. Se concluye que el biomodelo utilizado permite la evaluación y selección de cepas candidatas para vacunas vivas orales contra el cólera. </dc:description><dc:subject>Biomodelo</dc:subject><dc:subject>Vibrio cholerae</dc:subject><dc:subject>cepas atenuadas</dc:subject><dc:subject>ratón neonato.</dc:subject><dc:source>VacciMonitor</dc:source><dc:publisher>Finlay Ediciones</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:2812f2a42dd003c1f327d3e4ed5fed10</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T20:20:17Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Interacción del componente pertussis de células completas con los antígenos tetánico, Haemophilus influenzae tipo B y hepatitis B en ensayos de potencia para vacunas combinadas</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.finlay.sld.cu/publicaciones/vaccimonitor/Vm2008/a2.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1025028X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Mario Landys</dc:creator><dc:creator>Juan Miguel Figueroa</dc:creator><dc:creator>Ana Lara</dc:creator><dc:creator>Vicente Perdomo</dc:creator><dc:description>Las vacunas combinadas permiten un grado de aceptación mayor entre la población, dado que se requiere de menos inmunizacionespara proteger contra las enfermedades infecciosas. Sin embargo, esto ha generado nuevos retos, ya que se han reportado numerosasinteracciones entre los diferentes antígenos que conforman estas vacunas. El propósito del presente trabajo fue evaluar la nterferencia potencial del componente pertussis de células completas sobre los ensayos para determinar la actividad biológica de otros antígenos como toxoide tetánico, Haemophilus influenzae tipo b (Hib) y hepatitis B. Para ello se estudiaron mediante ensayos de potencia vacunas combinadas que contenían estos antígenos y se compararon con vacunas monovalentes. A su vez se prepararon adyuvaciones experimentales cuya composición permitió estimar adecuadamente la extensión y naturaleza de la interacción entre componentes. Se obtuvo que el componente pertussis incrementó significativamente la actividad biológica de Hib y tétanos, aunque esto puede depender mucho del modelo animal y el diseño experimental utilizado. En cuanto al antígeno de hepatitis B se demostró que pertussis inhibía la potencia de este antígeno, tanto in vitro como in vivo, aunque por mecanismos diferentes y de forma no significativa. </dc:description><dc:subject>Componente pertussis de células completas</dc:subject><dc:subject>interacciones</dc:subject><dc:subject>potencia de toxoide tetánico</dc:subject><dc:subject>antígeno de hepatitis B</dc:subject><dc:source>VacciMonitor</dc:source><dc:publisher>Finlay Ediciones</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:doaj-articles:5df6e6c9635b168c54f631a5f80291b3</identifier><datestamp>2008-09-04T20:38:51Z</datestamp><setSpec>Biology_and_Life_Sciences</setSpec><setSpec>Health_Sciences</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:oai_dc="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd"><dc:title>Purificación de lipopolisacárido de Neisseria meningitidis a partir de una fracción colateral del proceso de producción de VA-MENGOC-BC®</dc:title><dc:identifier>http://www.finlay.sld.cu/publicaciones/vaccimonitor/Vm2008/a3.pdf</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=openurl&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=1025028X&amp;date=2008&amp;volume=17&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=</dc:identifier><dc:creator>Julio A.

La purificación se realizó mediante precipitación con etanol al 80%, extracción de las proteínas con fenol al 90% entre 65-70 ºC y ultracentrifugación fraccionada a 105,000 g. Se obtuvieron tres lotes de LPS, en total 1,069 g, con un contenido de proteínas, ácidos nucleicos y ácido sálico respecto al LPS de 0,5%, 0,3% y 2,2% (m/m), respectivamente. La evaluación por cromatografía mostró una alta integridad molecular, con valores de constante de distribución reproducibles (0,36-0,38) y una posible asociación del ácido siálico al LPS. Se apreció homogeneidad en el perfil electroforético de los tres lotes y alta actividad endotóxica. El LPS purificado fue identificado fundamentalmente como del inmunotipo L3,7,9. El procedimiento de purificación empleado permite aprovechar una fracción colateral del proceso de producción de la vacuna, es escalable, no incluye métodos cromatográficos, y posibilita la obtención de gran cantidad de LPS de Neisseria meningitidis, no disponible en el mercado, con elevadapureza y alta actividad endotóxica.</dc:description><dc:subject>Lipopolisácarido</dc:subject><dc:subject>lipooligosacárido</dc:subject><dc:subject>purificación</dc:subject><dc:subject>Neisseria meningitidis</dc:subject><dc:subject>vacuna antimeningocócica</dc:subject><dc:source>VacciMonitor</dc:source><dc:publisher>Finlay Ediciones</dc:publisher><dc:date>2008</dc:date></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record><resumptionToken cursor="800" completeListSize="842"></resumptionToken></ListRecords></OAI-PMH>
