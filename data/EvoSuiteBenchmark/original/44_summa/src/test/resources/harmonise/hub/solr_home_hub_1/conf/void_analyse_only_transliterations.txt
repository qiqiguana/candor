# Summa character transliteration
# This is only used for analyze and not for index
# Transliteration rules for converting common non-ascii characters found in bibliographic records to ascii.
  
# Syntax:
#   "source" => "target"
#     "source".length() > 0 (source cannot be empty.)
#     "target".length() >= 0 (target can be empty.)

# example:
#   "À" => "A"
#   "\u00C0" => "A"
#   "\u00C0" => "\u0041"
#   "ß" => "ss"
#   "\t" => " "
#   "\n" => ""
