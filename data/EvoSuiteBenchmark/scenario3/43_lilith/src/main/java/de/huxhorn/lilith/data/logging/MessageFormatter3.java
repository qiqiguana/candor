/**
 * <p>Replacement for org.slf4j.helpers.MessageFormatter.</p>
 * <p>
 * In contrast to the mentioned class, the formatting of message pattern and arguments into the actual message
 * is split into three parts:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Counting of placeholders in the message pattern (cheap)</li>
 * <li>Conversion of argument array into an ArgumentResult, containing the arguments converted to String as well as
 * an optional Throwable if available (relatively cheap)</li>
 * <li>Replacement of placeholders in a message pattern with arguments given as String[]. (most expensive)</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * That way only the first two steps have to be done during event creation while the most expensive part, i.e. the
 * actual construction of the message, is only done on demand.
 * </p>
