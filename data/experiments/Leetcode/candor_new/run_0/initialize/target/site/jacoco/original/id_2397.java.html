    public int maximumRows(int[][] matrix, int numSelect) {
  /**
  You are given an m x n binary matrix matrix and an integer numSelect. Your goal is to select exactly numSelect distinct columns from matrix such that you cover as many rows as possible. A row is considered covered if all the 1&amp;#39;s in that row are also part of a column that you have selected. If a row does not have any 1s, it is also considered covered. More formally, let us consider selected = {c1, c2, ...., cnumSelect} as the set of columns selected by you. A row i is covered by selected if: For each cell where matrix[i][j] == 1, the column j is in selected. Or, no cell in row i has a value of 1. Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a set of numSelect columns. &amp;nbsp; Example 1: Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]], numSelect = 2 Output: 3 Explanation: One possible way to cover 3 rows is shown in the diagram above. We choose s = {0, 2}. - Row 0 is covered because it has no occurrences of 1. - Row 1 is covered because the columns with value 1, i.e. 0 and 2 are present in s. - Row 2 is not covered because matrix[2][1] == 1 but 1 is not present in s. - Row 3 is covered because matrix[2][2] == 1 and 2 is present in s. Thus, we can cover three rows. Note that s = {1, 2} will also cover 3 rows, but it can be shown that no more than three rows can be covered. Example 2: Input: matrix = [[1],[0]], numSelect = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: Selecting the only column will result in both rows being covered since the entire matrix is selected. &amp;nbsp; Constraints: m == matrix.length n == matrix[i].length 1 &amp;lt;= m, n &amp;lt;= 12 matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1. 1 &amp;lt;= numSelect&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;= n
