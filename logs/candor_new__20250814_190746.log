Here is the output in JSON format:

{
  "requirements": "The function xOrY should return the value of y if n is not a prime number, otherwise it should return the value of x.",
  "specifications": "∀x,y,n ∈ ℤ (isPrime(n) → xOrY(x,y,n) = x) ∧ (∼isPrime(n) → xOrY(x,y,n) = y)"
}
```

Note: The `isPrime` predicate is not defined in the problem statement, but it's assumed to be a function that checks whether a number is prime or not. In the specification, `∀x,y,n ∈ ℤ` means "for all integers x, y, and n", `→` is the implication operator, and `∧` is the conjunction operator.
